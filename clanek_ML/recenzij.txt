Consider streamlining these visualizations and relegating less critical elements, such as confusion matrices, to an appendix. Focus on the most insightful results, like those in Table 3.

Furthermore, the lack of domain-specific variables in the ML models might explain the subpar classification performance. Including such variables could enhance the predictive accuracy beyond random guessing. The limitations section should highlight these points and be moved to the end of the manuscript for better coherence.
The hypothesis development is not adequately grounded in the theoretical framework. A more comprehensive and clear formulation of hypotheses is needed, directly linked to the theories discussed earlier. The connection between tandem learning and ML in Chapter 2.3 is unconvincing and must be clarified. Introducing tandem learning as a specific aspect of ML’s application to predict learning outcomes could strengthen this section.
While the manuscript offers a promising exploration of tandem learning and ML, it requires substantial revision to achieve coherence and rigor. The theoretical framework, methodological justification, and interpretation of results need significant improvement. A more critical discussion of the findings is essential, especially given the poor performance of the ML models. Addressing these concerns will enhance the manuscript’s contribution to the field of mathematics education and ML.
