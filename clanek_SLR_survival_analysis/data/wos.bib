Title = {Prospective assessment of learning curve and impact of intensive versus
   progressive training in colonoscopy competence among French residents},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 11},
Abstract = {BackgroundsThere are no existing data in the literature on the learning
   curve of French interns in colonoscopy or on the comparison between
   different frequencies of colonoscopy training modalities. We aimed to
   assess the number of procedures required for French residents in
   hepatogastroenterology to achieve competency in colonoscopy.MethodsThe
   primary outcome was achieving greater than 90\% cecal intubation rate
   (CIR90) competency using the Learning Curve-Cumulative Summation
   (LC-CUSUM) method. Participants with over 80 procedures were categorized
   into intensive and progressive training groups. We compared the
   proportion of residents reaching competency, the number of colonoscopies
   to reach it, and the speed of competency.ResultsThe study included 81
   residents, totaling 6,259 procedures. 29 did more than 80 procedures: 12
   in the progressive group and 17 in the intensive group. 204
   colonoscopies were needed for reaching CIR90 competency (21\% of
   residents). Achievement rates were similar across groups: 50\% in the
   progressive and 65\% in the intensive group (p = 0.50). LC competency
   was reached by 8.6\% of residents after an average of 225 procedures,
   with no significant difference between groups (p = 0.21). Survival
   analysis showed no significant difference in the speed of competency
   acquisition between groups (p = 0.77 and p = 0.14, respectively). The
   Polyp Detection Rate (PDR) averaged 40\%.ConclusionGiven that only 21\%
   reached CIR90, efforts are needed to increase the number of
   colonoscopies during training.Clinical trial numberNot applicable.},

Journal = {EDUCATION AND URBAN SOCIETY},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 FEB 6},
Abstract = {Teacher shortages, especially in high-need subjects and schools, are a
   long-standing issue in many districts, and teacher turnover is a key
   driver. In this article, we examine the association between Urban
   Advantage (UA), a professional development-focused science initiative,
   and middle school science teacher retention in the nation's largest
   school district, New York City (NYC). We use detailed teacher-level
   administrative personnel data on 19 cohorts of teachers from NYC and UA
   program participation data and estimate likelihood of turnover using a
   discrete-time hazard model. UA teachers are roughly 3.8 percentage
   points less likely than similarly situated non-UA teachers to leave
   their school the following year. This study contributes to the limited
   evidence on how professional development-focused programs can promote
   teacher retention in hard-to-staff subjects and schools.},

   Funding for Higher Education in the United States},
Journal = {RESEARCH IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {66},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Between 1997 and 2019, 16 out of 41 performance-based funding (PBF)
   states discontinued their PBF policies for public colleges and
   universities. Adapting policy diffusion theory to PBF discontinuation,
   we investigate whether policy discontinuation in one state is related to
   discontinuations in other states, and differentiate between the two
   policy diffusion mechanisms of imitation and emulation. While many prior
   studies consider diffusion as occurring only between neighboring states
   and focus exclusively on policy adoption, we conceptualize policy
   diffusion as occurring across geographically far-apart states and
   address the rarely-studied event of discontinuation. We employ dyadic
   survival analysis techniques and find that states are not prone to
   policy diffusion in a broad sense, irrespective of geographic proximity,
   but states are more likely to imitate PBF discontinuation in another
   state when the two are more similar on political conditions represented
   by party control. In contrast, states do not emulate other states with
   desirable characteristics, such as being wealthier or more generous
   towards higher education. PBF discontinuation is also explained by
   individual state conditions; greater legislative professionalism,
   stronger governor's budget powers, and higher unemployment rates
   increase the likelihood of policy discontinuation.},

Title = {Is Admission Enough? University Persistence of Students Admitted Through
   Affirmative Action Policies in Chile},
Journal = {HIGHER EDUCATION POLICY},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 JAN 13},
Abstract = {Affirmative action policies have been implemented in various regions of
   the globe as a strategy to promote equity in access to higher education.
   In Chile, some affirmative action policies have been implemented to
   reduce inequality in access to the most selective universities during
   last decade. However, in addition to access, it is important to consider
   the persistence of students to ensure their success within the system.
   The persistence of students admitted to 11 Chilean universities through
   affirmative action was analyzed using a multilevel discrete-time
   survival model and matching procedures. The results indicate that those
   admitted through special quota were more likely to drop out at the end
   of the first two years. However, the initial dropout rate was attributed
   to lower grades, while the dropout rate in the second year was observed
   even in cases where performance was the same. Institutions should
   implement programs oriented toward promoting students' academic and
   social integration in the university taking structural inequalities into
   account, as well as the effort and resilience of students.},

Title = {Fleeing School Choice? Resident Student Exit from Suburban School
   Districts},
Journal = {EDUCATION POLICY ANALYSIS ARCHIVES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {33},
Abstract = {This study examines the movement of students in suburban Detroit through
   open enrollment, or inter-district school choice. We examine whether
   absolute levels and changes in the district enrollment of Black,
   economically disadvantaged, and nonresident students are perceived as
   racial threats by suburban families, leading them to exit their local
   school districts, through school or residential mobility. Using a
   multilevel discrete time survival analysis, we found that, for each
   standard deviation increase in the absolute percentage of Black students
   in the district, resident students were nearly eight times more likely
   to use school choice to exit their district the subsequent school year,
   and for every standard deviation increase in the change of Black
   enrollment in the district, resident students were 32 times more likely
   to move to a new district. For every standard deviation increase in the
   absolute percentage of nonresident students in the district, a resident
   student was 3.5 times more likely to move to a different district. This
   study adds to the evidence that school choice policies may contribute to
   racial inequality and raises questions about the logic of shifting state
   education resources to nonresident districts, rather than investing in
   strengthening urban and exurban school systems.},

Title = {Barriers to school retention in Pakistan: an evaluation using survival

Journal = {EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH AND EVALUATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 29},
Abstract = {This study applied Cox Proportional Hazard model to determine the
   supply-side and demand-side factors associated with early school dropout
   in Pakistan. Hazard ratios are calculated using MICS6 data on children
   between the age of 5-17 years. The individual, collective and social
   factors are explored along with the role of education performance,
   readiness and schooling attributes. Child labor, poverty and cognitive
   and functional difficulty are found major impediments for successful
   transition to a higher level of schooling. The input measures such as
   regularity in homework, teacher's feedback, presence of school governing
   body, active parent-teacher associations and the output indicator
   measured as learning scores are found to have a significant association
   in reducing school dropouts. The study also observes that early
   childhood readiness, better school infrastructure, education
   performance, readiness toward higher level schooling as well as higher
   level school availability considerably reduce the risk of school
   dropouts. A voucher scheme for education attainment specifically in
   impoverished regions could play an important role in improving school
   retention. The general principle of `access to education{''} must be
   prioritized toward ``quality education{''} to improve the learning
   outcomes. Parental involvement and school governance system must also be
   strengthened vis-\& agrave;-vis a conducive household environment for
   child development.},

Title = {Student attrition in gender-atypical fields of study: a case of
   disapproval by parents and friends or lacking social integration?},
Journal = {ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ERZIEHUNGSWISSENSCHAFT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 25},
Abstract = {In most industrialized countries, the choice of college majors is
   segregated by gender. Few students enroll in gender-atypical majors.
   Previous studies suggested that some attrition risks are associated with
   the gender composition of majors. In this paper, I investigated whether
   students in gender-atypical majors are more likely to leave the major by
   dropping out or switching to a different major with more same-sex
   students than those majoring in gender-typical subjects. Furthermore, I
   hypothesized that the relation between gender composition and
   non-completion risks is partially mediated by two social processes,
   namely poor social integration and disapproval of the major from parents
   and friends. Using data from undergraduate students from the German
   National Educational Panel Study, I conducted discrete-time survival
   analyses and a KHB decomposition. I found that both men and women in
   gender-atypical majors have a higher risk of switching to a major with a
   higher percentage of same-sex students than students in gender-typical
   majors. Women in gender-atypical majors also have a higher dropout risk.
   Poor social integration and disapproval of the major by parents and
   friends increase the switching risk and, in the case of social
   integration, also the dropout risk for all students. However, these two
   aspects cannot explain the higher attrition risk for students in
   gender-atypical majors, with one exception. Only for women in
   gender-atypical majors, lower approval of the major by friends partly
   mediates the association between the gender composition of the major and
   the risk of switching to a more female-dominated major.
   In den meisten Industriel \& auml;ndern ist die Studienfachwahl
   geschlechtsspezifisch. Wenige Studierende entscheiden sich f \& uuml;r
   ein geschlechtsuntypisches Studienfach. Bisherige Studien
   verdeutlichten, dass es einen Zusammenhang zwischen der
   Geschlechterzusammensetzung eines Studienfaches und dem
   Studienabbruchrisiko gibt. In der vorliegenden Studie untersuchte ich,
   ob Studierende in geschlechtsuntypischen Studienf \& auml;chern mit h \&
   ouml;herer Wahrscheinlichkeit das Studienfach verlassen als solche in
   geschlechtstypischen F \& auml;chern, in dem Sie das Studium abbrechen
   oder zu einem Fach mit einer h \& ouml;heren Zahl an
   gleichgeschlechtlichen Studierenden wechseln. Zudem nahm ich an, dass
   der Zusammenhang zwischen der Geschlechterzusammensetzung eines
   Studienfaches und dem Risiko, das Fach ohne Abschluss zu verlassen
   teilweise von zwei sozialen Prozessen mediiert wird, n \& auml;mlich
   schlechter sozialer Integration und Missbilligung des Studienfaches
   durch Eltern und Freunde. Auf Basis von Daten des Nationalen
   Bildungspanels zu Bachelor-Studierenden sch \& auml;tzte ich diskrete
   Ereignisanalysemodelle und f \& uuml;hrte eine KHB Dekomposition durch.
   Die Ergebnisse zeigten, dass M \& auml;nner und Frauen in
   geschlechtsuntypischen Studienf \& auml;chern ein h \& ouml;heres Risiko
   aufweisen, zu einem Studienfach mit mehr gleichgeschlechtlichen
   Studierenden zu wechseln als Studierende in geschlechtstypischen
   Studienf \& auml;chern. Frauen in geschlechtsuntypischen F \& auml;chern
   haben zudem ein erh \& ouml;htes Studienabbruchsrisiko. Eine ungen \&
   uuml;gende soziale Integration und die Missbilligung des Studienfaches
   durch Eltern und Freunde erh \& ouml;ht das Studienfachwechselrisiko und
   im Falle der sozialen Integration auch das Studienabbruchsrisiko. Diese
   beiden Aspekte tragen aber nicht zur Erkl \& auml;rung des erh \&
   ouml;hten Risikos von Studierenden in geschlechtsuntypischen Studienf \&
   auml;chern, das Fach ohne Abschluss zu verlassen, bei, mit einer
   Ausnahme. Nur f \& uuml;r Frauen in geschlechtsuntypischen Studienf \&
   auml;chern wird der Zusammenhang zwischen der
   Geschlechterzusammensetzung des Studienfaches und dem Risiko zu einem st
   \& auml;rker frauendominierten Studienfach zu wechseln durch eine st \&
   auml;rkere Missbilligung des Studienfaches durch Freunde mediiert.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {9},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Introduction Student dropout, as a dynamic and complex system, requires
   a broad conceptualization. The aim of this article is to analyze the
   concept of student dropout in higher education, with the aim of
   effectively addressing it at various levels, including both
   institutional and societal.Methods Using a mixed-methods approach,
   dropout patterns were traced, and a model was designed and validated
   using anonymized data from 17,328 students at a Colombian higher
   education institution offering face-to-face programs.Results Results
   from decision trees and survival analysis highlight the significance of
   economic and academic factors in increasing the risk of dropout and
   contributing to low graduation rates. It has been confirmed that the
   first two years of enrollment in the educational institution are crucial
   for the likelihood of dropout, and that extended time spent at the
   institution also increases the risk of dropout.Discussion The study
   highlights the dynamic complexity of student dropout and emphasizes the
   importance of continuously updating models by integrating diverse
   analysis techniques. Socioeconomic status and academic performance
   emerged as key factors, with a focus on students at intermediate levels.},

Title = {Is informedness the key? An empirical analysis of VET dropouts in
   Germany},
Journal = {EMPIRICAL RESEARCH IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 14},
Abstract = {In 2022, one in four vocational education and training (VET) contracts
   resulted in premature termination-a potential sign of inefficiency in
   the training of urgently needed skilled professionals. This study
   focuses on the level of perceived informedness of trainees and its
   potential influence on dropout. This includes trainees' perceived level
   of information about the characteristics and requirements of an
   occupation, which may result from various sources of information in the
   form of social contacts. We draw on theories from the field of career
   choice and job search to argue that a better level of informedness can
   reduce uncertainty and enable individuals to make better-informed
   decisions about their careers. With better informedness, there is a
   higher probability of finding a suitable match between a trainee and
   their chosen occupation, ultimately increasing their likelihood of job
   persistence. This should also lead to a lower probability of dropout
   among VETs. Using data from the National Educational Panel Study,
   starting cohort 4, we employed event history analysis. We show that good
   perceived informedness on the requirements of one's vocational training
   and the perception of good school-based vocational preparation reduce
   the probability of dropping out. In contrast, good informedness about
   alternative training programs increases dropout risk. We also see that
   the distinction between closer or more distant groups of people from the
   social network (strong or weak ties) who provide information about
   training is not decisive.},

Title = {Methodological learning curve: predilection for qualitative over
   quantitative approaches in Zimbabwean social work dissertations},
Journal = {SOCIAL WORK EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 5},
Abstract = {This study examines the nature of competency required of social work
   students in qualitative and quantitative methods as well as the
   preferred learning period duration for the acquisition of proficiency in
   each method. Utilising a descriptive-correlational design, data was
   gathered from a sample of 1268 social work students who completed their
   dissertations during their last year of study. The Kaplan-Meier survival
   analysis indicated that social work students need a longer duration to
   acquire proficiency in quantitative research strategies as opposed to
   qualitative and mixed methodologies. The hazard function prediction
   analysis indicated a significant likelihood of quantitative approaches
   not being utilized in students' dissertations, in contrast to other
   approaches. In terms of course structure, the majority (72\%) of social
   work students learned both qualitative and quantitative approaches
   simultaneously. A simple linear regression analysis revealed that the
   research course structure had a statistically significant effect (p <
   .05) in predicting the improvement in the learning curve for particular
   methodological methods. We propose that the research method course
   structure be customized to meet the specific needs of students, such as
   providing methodological training and capacity development, implementing
   a research mentorship programme, fostering a supportive learning
   environment in all methodological approaches, and promoting
   inter-professional collaboration.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine research on school dropout in
   open and distance education in the Web of Science (WoS) database using
   bibliometric analysis and to reveal trends in this area. In line with
   this goal, a total of 1,615 studies published between 1980 and 2022 were
   identified in the Web of Science (WoS) indexes. Descriptive and
   evaluative bibliometric methods were employed in the analysis of these
   publications, and the results were visualized using VOSviewer software.
   According to the research findings, studies on school dropout in open
   and distance education intensified in 2019. The analysis revealed that
   E.T. Pascarella is the most cited author, and F.D. Pereira has the
   highest co-authorship network. An examination based on institutions
   showed that the Universitat Aut \& ograve;noma de Barcelona has the
   highest number of publications, while the University of Michigan ranks
   first in terms of citation numbers. Furthermore, in terms of publication
   productivity and citation numbers, the United States is ranked first,
   followed by Spain. Looking at the keywords used in articles on the
   topic, early studies emphasized concepts such as ``distance ``survival
   analysis{''}, ``education policy{''}, ``graduation{''}, and ``financial
   aids{''}. In subsequent years, these were replaced by terms such as
   ``learning analytics{''}, ``educational data mining{''}, ``systematic
   review{''}, ``engagement{''}, MOOC{''}, and ``artificial
   intelligence{''}. In this context, discussions were conducted within the
   framework of the literature, and various recommendations were provided
   based on the obtained findings.},

Title = {What leads to a professorship in German economics? A longitudinal
   analysis of tenure determinants (1984-2021)},
Journal = {STUDIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 1},
Abstract = {This study uses event history analysis to show what promotes tenure in
   German economics, utilizing a unique and virtually complete national
   dataset that includes 70,657 publications from 3955 economists, of which
   1196 received tenure between 1984 and 2021. While existing theories
   emphasize that gender discrimination, parenthood, human capital,
   academic prestige, and social capital explain who is tenured, no study
   has thus far evaluated these factors concurrently across an entire
   national population of economists. Our findings reveal that fewer women
   receive tenure than would be expected based on their representation in
   the candidate pool. However, gender, parenthood, and non-reviewed
   publications do not significantly influence tenure attainment after
   controlling for covariates. Instead, mobility, accessing advanced career
   stages, and peer-reviewed journal articles are most strongly related to
   receiving tenure. Independently of productivity, academic prestige, such
   as receiving grants and awards, also impacts tenure prospects
   significantly, as does social capital, measured through research
   mobility, interim professorships and co-authorships. Being affiliated
   with prestigious universities shows minimal effects on receiving tenure,
   however. These findings imply that mobility, moving up career stages and
   being productive by publishing peer-reviewed journal articles are the
   strongest determinants of becoming a tenured economics professor in
   Germany.},

Title = {Looking Beyond Representation: Gender Inequities in Research Attrition,
   Output, Leadership, and Collaboration in Chilean Education Researchers'
   Career Trajectories},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF DIVERSITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Despite a more favorable representation of women in highly feminized
   academic fields, such as education, gender disparities manifest
   themselves across different dimensions of faculty work and unfold over
   the course of research careers. In this study, we focus on the role of
   gender in shaping the careers of Chilean education researchers. Using
   survival, Poisson regression, and social network analyses, we examined
   gendered patterns of attrition, research output, first authorship, and
   coauthorship across researchers' career trajectories. Bibliometric data
   were analyzed for the 5,702 authors who published articles in
   Scopus-indexed education journals between 2011 and 2021 while affiliated
   with a Chilean institution. Our results show that, despite similar
   initial representation, being a female researcher increases attrition
   hazard by 21.5\%, with women at the beginning of their research career
   being particularly at risk of attrition. We also found a significant
   gender gap in the number of articles published, with Chilean female
   education researchers publishing, on average, 20.8\% fewer articles than
   male researchers, a disparity that increases in magnitude with years of
   research experience. However, there were no significant gender
   differences in research leadership (i.e., first authorships). In
   relation to collaboration profiles, female researchers showed
   significantly fewer coauthorships and were more likely to engage in
   national collaborations when compared to male researchers, who tended to
   develop more international (both regional and nonregional) collaboration
   profiles. Furthermore, coauthorship patterns showed significant levels
   of gender and research experience homophily. Possible explanations
   pertaining to structural barriers faced by female researchers and policy
   implications are discussed.},

Title = {Examining career trajectories of Norwegian PhD recipients: slower
   progression for women academics but not a leaky pipeline},
Journal = {STUDIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 10},
Abstract = {We use longitudinal data for the entire population of Norwegian PhD
   recipients over five decades to examine why only one-third of full
   professors in Norway are women, despite gender balance among current
   PhDs. We find that 90\% of the lower female representation is due to
   lower female proportions in earlier PhD cohorts, increasing sizes of
   cohorts, and decreasing overall rates of promotion, which together we
   call `compositional/historical factors'. We find that the remaining
   imbalance is not caused by women dropping out, but rather by 14-18\%
   slower average promotion rates calculated using hazard analysis.
   However, on average, women eventually catch up with men after about 20
   years, although this differs by field. A similar hazard analysis for the
   US shows that women doctorates are less likely than men to enter
   tenure-track academia although more likely to enter non-tenure-track
   academia. This leads to larger US gender differences in advancement to
   full professorships and no eventual convergence. We suggest possible
   reasons for the differences between Norway and the US.},

Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Despite the acknowledged impact of early science achievement on future
   success, there is a noticeable gap in research focused on understanding
   the dynamic longitudinal patterns of children attaining science learning
   milestones in their early years, as well as few investigations of
   potential factors that may mitigate gender, racial/ethnic, and
   socio-economic disparities. This study analyzed nationally
   representative data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study of
   Kindergarten Cohort 2011 (ECLS-K: 2011), involving 18,174 children from
   1328 schools across the United States, selected through a multistage
   probability sampling process and spanning kindergarten through 5th
   grade. Using survival analysis with the dependent variable as the time
   required to attain a specific milestone, the study revealed that boys,
   non-Black, non-Hispanic, and high-income children reached the science
   learning threshold earlier than their counterparts-girls, Black,
   Hispanic, and low-income children. Furthermore, the study underscored
   the crucial role of language and literacy skills in mitigating these
   disparities. The study's implications stress the importance of targeted
   interventions to address early science education disparities,
   emphasizing professional development and integrating language and
   literacy with science learning. The research also enriches the global
   discourse on educational standards by introducing innovative
   methodologies to assess both the frequency and duration of science
   learning milestones.},

Title = {Quantifying attrition in science: a cohort-based, longitudinal study of
   scientists in 38 OECD countries},
Journal = {HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 23},
Abstract = {In this paper, we explore how members of the scientific community leave
   academic science and how attrition (defined as ceasing to publish)
   differs across genders, academic disciplines, and over time. Our
   approach is cohort-based and longitudinal: We track individual male and
   female scientists over time and quantify the phenomenon traditionally
   referred to as ``leaving science.{''} Using publication metadata from
   Scopus-a global bibliometric database of publications and citations-we
   follow the details of the publishing careers of scientists from 38 OECD
   countries who started publishing in 2000 (N = 142,776) and 2010 (N =
   232,843). Our study is restricted to 16 STEMM disciplines (science,
   technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine), and we track the
   individual scholarly output of the two cohorts until 2022. We use
   survival analysis to compare attrition of men and women scientists. With
   more women in science and more women within cohorts, attrition is
   becoming ever less gendered. In addition to the combined aggregated
   changes at the level of all STEMM disciplines, widely nuanced changes
   were found to occur at the discipline level and over time. Attrition in
   science means different things for men versus women depending on the
   discipline; moreover, it means different things for scientists from
   different cohorts entering the scientific workforce. Finally, global
   bibliometric datasets were tested in the current study, opening new
   opportunities to explore gender and disciplinary differences in
   attrition.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveSummer research programs can support medical students' exposure
   to research and scholarly activity, and strengthen their applications
   for residency positions, particularly if students are able to generate
   peer-reviewed publications resulting from their summer experience. We
   aimed to estimate the rate of publication among medical student summer
   projects and identify any predictors of projects' progress to
   publication.MethodsProjects were identified from abstract books
   published by five medical schools' summer research programs for rising
   second-year medical students. Resulting publications were queried in
   PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Abstract characteristics were
   correlated with publication outcomes using bivariate analysis.ResultsWe
   identified 158 eligible abstracts representing medical student summer
   research projects. Overall, 34\% resulted in publication, but
   Kaplan-Meier analysis found that only one-quarter were published within
   3 years of presentation (i.e., around the time of graduation from
   medical school). No abstract characteristics were associated with odds
   of any vs. no publication, and only disclosure of project funding was
   (negatively) associated with the hazard of publication.ConclusionsSummer
   research programs fostering medical students' engagement in research may
   not directly lead to the publication of work completed during the
   program for most participants. Tracking the likelihood of publishing
   summer project results can help medical schools effectively advise
   students on how to maximize the utility of their participation in
   extracurricular research, without leading to burnout or disenchantment.
   Further research is needed to understand how connecting students and
   mentors with longitudinal support after the end of a summer program
   might facilitate project completion and publication.},

Title = {College President Departure After No-Confidence Votes: An Event History
   Analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 15},
Abstract = {Faculty-led no-confidence votes against college presidents have
   increased over the past decade. These votes often aim to create
   conditions that lead to the president's departure. In this study, I used
   event history analysis to investigate the influence of faculty-led
   no-confidence votes on the tenure of college presidents. The analysis
   reveals that nearly 70\% of presidents leave their positions within four
   semesters of a no-confidence vote. The study further explores the
   influence of various factors, including institutional and presidential
   characteristics, on the likelihood of presidential departure after
   no-confidence votes. The results indicate that student enrollment size
   is the only significant predictor, with smaller institutions more likely
   to experience leadership turnover following a vote. The study concludes
   that no-confidence votes are a powerful tool for facilitating
   presidential change across diverse institutional types. These findings
   have important implications for faculty governance bodies and boards of
   trustees, highlighting the need for strategic planning in response to
   such votes.},

Abstract = {Despite the potential for personalized learning, e-learning courses
   often suffer from low completion rates. In order to address this issue,
   we propose and empirically test a theoretical mechanism that examines
   how gamification can enhance the completion rate in adaptive learning
   courses by promoting a more positive behavioral response and attitude
   among students. To identify causal effects, we employ a
   quasi-experimental design with a time-discontinuity in treatment
   attribution. Our study involves a sample of 6592 adults who participated
   in a Belgian financial education platform. The effect sizes were
   estimated using non-parametric survival analysis. Our findings indicate
   that gamification led to a 5.7\% increase in the number of questions
   answered and a 1.6 percentage point rise in the completion rate. These
   effects were particularly pronounced among younger individuals, single
   adults, and in relation to socioeconomic status questions used in the
   personalization survey. However, gamification did not significantly
   impact the completion rate for decision-making questions. By
   demonstrating that gamification serves as a causal mechanism for
   enhancing completion rates in adaptive learning courses, our study
   contributes to the underlying e-learning theory. Specifically, we
   highlight the role of psychological factors, such as improved behavior
   and attitude, which are particularly relevant during personalization
   surveys.},

Abstract = {How to make own advantages when submitting applications and increase the
   probability of getting a job early? The target of this study is to
   analyse the determinants of unemployment duration and the probability of
   seeking a job after graduation. It is carried out by using survival
   analysis along with the Cox model and Kaplan-Meier estimator and based
   on the dataset integrated from survey data and academic data. The
   empirical results show that taking part-time jobs related to training
   majors and setting goals as well as planning to go internship early have
   a positive influence on the ability of students to get a job early. The
   results also reveal that the mother's occupation, the type of internment
   enterprise, the type of work contract, and the refusal of job
   opportunities offered previously have a negative impact on students'
   chances of escaping unemployment. The findings are the basis for
   students to properly assess their advantages and disadvantages. Thereby,
   they can determine the goal of a job that suits their capacity and have
   a reasonable plan combined with their efforts to achieve it. They also
   support companies to identify groups of potential students and build
   their suitable evaluation criteria in recruitment.},

Title = {Statewide Community College Promise Programs: An Event History Analysis},
Journal = {COMMUNITY COLLEGE JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 4},
Abstract = {Between the 2014 adoption of the Tennessee Promise Act and 2019, 16
   states enacted their own statewide promise program policies making
   community college tuition free for numerous students. In this study, we
   sought to determine which state-level factors predicted the adoption of
   a statewide promise program policy. Using data from 2013 to 2019, we
   conducted an event history analysis to identify state-level political,
   economic, social, and higher education system conditions that predicted
   promise program policy adoption. Partisan control of state government,
   total state population, percentage of state population identified as
   white, and percentage of state appropriations allocated to community
   colleges were associated with statewide promise program policy adoption.
   Our findings suggest that there is no single factor or grand narrative
   that results in promise program policy adoption. Instead, the results
   highlight the complexities within the policymaking process.
   Between 2014 and 2019, 16 states enacted statewide promise program
   policies making community college tuition free for numerous students.
   Policymaking is a complex process that involves a variety of actors and
   unique state contexts. Using publicly available data from 2013 to 2019,
   we examined partisan make-up of state governments, economic conditions,
   social factors, and higher education systems to see if one or more of
   these factors predicted promise program policy adoption. The result of
   our study suggests that there is no single factor or grand narrative
   that results in promise program policy adoption.},

   Methodological Alternative for Studying Student Trajectories in Higher
   Education},
Journal = {PAGINAS DE EDUCACION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUL-DEC},
Abstract = {This article explores the application of advanced statistical methods,
   specifically survival analysis, to examine academic trajectories in
   higher education, underscoring its advantages over traditional models
   that often struggle with incomplete data or events of uncertain
   duration. In particular, the Kaplan-Meier method, Cox regression, and
   the log-rank test are highlighted for their ability to handle censored
   and uneven data, offering a more accurate perspective on the timing of
   key events such as dropout or graduation. This methodological approach
   not only enables comparisons of academic pathways across different
   groups but also provides a deeper understanding of the time spent in the
   academic process, going beyond traditional success-or-failure analyses.
   By focusing on time as the main variable, the article illustrates how
   these statistical tools can enhance educational research and support
   decision- making in the university setting. The goal is to understand
   when and how critical educational events occur and how they depend on
   various factors, emphasizing the need to rigorously adapt methods to the
   specific study objectives. This approach strengthens the interpretation
   of results and aids in understanding how students make decisions about
   continuing or discontinuing their studies.},

   background and pre-tertiary vocational qualifications},
Journal = {EMPIRICAL RESEARCH IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Prior research has shown that students from lower socio-economic
   backgrounds are less likely to graduate. We examine if this can be
   explained by background-specific pathways into higher education. Many
   students in Germany enter higher education with a vocational
   qualification and prior vocational qualifications occur more often among
   students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. We argue that vocational
   qualifications shift opportunity structures and opportunity costs of
   students who have to decide between continuing higher education and
   alternative options. We therefore examine if parental background and
   vocational qualifications are associated with the destinations after
   non-completion. We distinguish the destinations ``re-entering higher
   education{''}, ``vocational training{''} and ``skilled employment{''}.
   Using the German Educational Panel Study (NEPS starting cohort 6), we
   apply competing risks models. Our results show that non-completers from
   higher socio-economic backgrounds are more likely to re-enter higher
   education than non-completers from lower socio-economic backgrounds. The
   higher rates of transfer to skilled employment among non-completers from
   lower backgrounds are mainly due to the fact that they more often hold a
   vocational qualification and have good chances to enter the skilled
   labour market without additional educational investments. Our results
   hence shed some new light on the question how vocational training
   ``diverts{''} lower background students from higher education.},

Abstract = {Retention of higher education students is of major concern within the
   United Kingdom due to the financial and reputational impact on
   institutions, financial and personal impact on students and loss of
   potential skills and knowledge within society. Student background
   characteristics are acknowledged as the initial factors influencing
   retention within various models, however subject specific understanding
   is limited. This study aimed to identify pre-enrolment factors
   associated with student retention in Sport, Health and Exercise Science
   programmes. Student retention at department and programme level were
   calculated by `time to event' analysis using Kaplan-Meier survival trend
   curves and log rank (Mantel-Cox) analysis for; gender, age, locality to
   the university, highest qualification on entry and participation of
   local areas in higher education (POLAR4) classifications. Results
   identified that male students, students from low Higher Education
   participation neighbourhoods and students who enter Higher Education
   without A-Level or foundation qualifications were at an increased risk
   of degree non-completion. Importantly, these characteristics were also
   disproportionally high in the student populations considered here. It is
   imperative that initiatives to improve retention, particularly in these
   populations, are sought and implemented at department level to improve
   student and institutional outcomes.},

Abstract = {An international movement is underway to promote the recognition of

   pathway towards the upper secondary VET diploma from a social justice

   survival analysis with administrative data, the results show that, under
   certain conditions, the RPL helps promote access to an upper secondary
   vocational education and training (VET) diploma, especially for
   experienced workers without a diploma. Indeed, some personal (e.g.
   immigration status) and social conversion factors (e.g. involvement of
   employers in the RPL pathway) are associated with the time until
   graduation through RPL. The discussion highlights the relevance of using
   survival analysis when examining the association between conversion
   factors and the RPL pathway. The conclusion sheds light on the relevance
   of incorporating a temporal dimension when analysing pathway in RPL and

Month = {2024 APR 13},
Abstract = {This study examines predictors of college success in 968 students,
   focusing on the influence of grit, demographic, and academic factors,
   using logistic and Cox regression analyses. It finds that higher grit
   scores significantly predict increased graduation rates and decreased
   dropout rates, with gender, ACT scores, entry-level, and summer course
   enrollment as key factors. The research highlights the importance of
   considering broader socioeconomic and systemic contexts that affect the
   development of resilience and grit. It emphasizes that resilience and
   grit are not only personal attributes but also outcomes shaped by
   socioeconomic status and systemic barriers, such as income disparities
   and institutional biases. The study advocates for educational
   environments that support individual resilience and grit while
   addressing socio-economic and systemic inequalities to promote equitable
   student success. This approach calls for integrated supportive
   structures and policies within educational institutions to alleviate the
   compounded challenges faced by students, ensuring resilience and grit
   are nurtured within a context that recognizes and confronts systemic

Abstract = {By utilising the National Graduate Survey (NGS) - class of 2005 and

   suggest considerable differences in the duration to first job after
   graduation for various fields of study - with `Agriculture, natural
   resources and conservation', `Health and related fields', and STEM
   fields like Math, Computer Science, and Engineering landing jobs the
   quickest, respectively. In contrast, the graduates of `Humanities' and
   `Education' had the longest duration of finding employment. The results

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The objective of the present study is to evaluate the
   association between longitudinal and survival outcomes in the presence
   of competing risk events. To illustrate the application of joint
   modeling in clinical research, we assessed the blood oxygen saturation
   (SPO2) and its association with survival outcomes in coronavirus disease
   (COVID-19). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we
   followed 300 COVID-19 patients, who were diagnosed with severe COVID-19
   in the Rohani Hospital in Babol, the north of Iran from October 22, 2020
   to March 5, 2021, where death was the event of interest, surviving was
   the competing risk event and SPO2 was the longitudinal outcome. Joint
   modeling analyses were compared to separate analyses for these data.
   RESULT: The estimation of the association parameter in the joint
   modeling verified the association between longitudinal outcome SPO2 with
   survival outcome of death (Hazard Ratio (HR) = 0.33, P = 0.001) and the
   competing risk outcome of surviving (HR = 4.18, P < 0.001). Based on the
   joint modeling, longitudinal outcome (SPO2) decreased in hypertension
   patients (beta = -0.28, P = 0.581) and increased in those with a high
   level of SPO2 on admission (beta = 0.75, P = 0.03). Also, in the
   survival submodel in the joint model, the risk of death survival outcome
   increased in patients with diabetes comorbidity (HR = 4.38, P = 0.026).
   CONCLUSION: The association between longitudinal measurements of SPO2
   and survival outcomes of COVID-19 confirms that SPO2 is an important
   indicator in this disease. Thus, the application of this joint model can
   provide useful clinical evidence in the different areas of medical
   sciences.},

Abstract = {Since the late 1990s, the number of college student loan debtors has
   increased rapidly in Japan. Despite the uniqueness of Japanese higher
   education policies in terms of tuition levels and heavy reliance on
   educational loans rather than grants, few studies have focused on the
   influence of student loans on adult youths' lives. This study is the
   first to provide a detailed analysis of the relationship between student
   loan debt and youth life events. We explored the impact of student loan
   debt on family formation, using a data set of college graduates
   collected in 2017. We employed survival analysis methods to understand
   the relationship between student loan debt and marital decisions, and
   negative binomial models to analyze the impact of this debt on
   childbearing. The results showed that 2-year college graduate women with
   student loan debt were more likely to delay marital decisions than women
   without student loan debt. Taking out student loans also had a negative
   correlation to childbearing, which was also stronger for 2-year college
   graduate women. In conclusion, this study revealed that the Japanese
   government's reliance on student loans has unexpected consequences. Even
   following recent reforms, student loan debt continues to be a major
   financial burden for young Japanese people and is likely to negatively
   affect family formation in Japan, which has already seen a decline in
   marriage and fertility rates over the last few decades. Our results call
   for additional policies to mitigate the negative influence of the
   Japanese college student aid system.},

Abstract = {A recent major reform of higher education has changed a year-based

Abstract = {The labor-market payoff to workers with associate degrees in healthcare

   this by using multinomial logit analysis to compare trends across 12
   cohorts of MACC entrants in the proportion of students who earned an AD
   in a healthcare or STEM program within six years of entry.We find a
   substantial increase across cohorts in the proportion of students who
   earned an AD in a STEM program, but not in the proportion who earned an
   AD in a healthcare program. We found differences in degree attainment by
   student gender, race/ethnicity, family income, and 10th-Grade
   mathematics score. Interviews with MACC program leaders revealed that
   supply constraints hinder expansion of many healthcare AD programs, but
   not STEM programs.},

Abstract = {In the landscape of educational analytics, the usage of Machine Learning
   (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Survival Analysis (SA), for student
   dropout prediction often encounters challenges in effectively detecting
   dropout cases and explaining dropout reasons. This is due to many
   challenges such as data imbalance, data processing issues, cold start
   problem, and the limited explainability of the predictive models. This
   paper explores the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) for dropout
   prediction to tackle the previous challenges. We introduce an approach
   that leverages the adaptability and contextual understanding of LLMs to
   discern subtle indicators of potential dropout risks. In particular, we
   employ a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-assisted few-shot learning
   paradigm and prompt engineering to transfer the knowledge of LLMs. An
   intensive experimentation of our approach has been conducted using
   real-life Moroccan student data containing academic, demographic, and
   socio-economic information, to predict yearly school dropouts. Our
   findings highlight that LLMs outperform baseline ML models while showing
   the ability to produce textual analysis of students' data. Thus, LLMs
   have a promising potential to be employed as student dropout prediction
   assistants in educational institutions hoping to mitigate this
   phenomenon.},

Title = {Rolling the DICE (Design, Interpret, Compute, Estimate): Interactive
   Learning of Biostatistics With Simulations},
Journal = {JMIR MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {10},
Abstract = {Despite the increasing relevance of statistics in health sciences,
   teaching styles in higher education are remarkably similar across
   disciplines: lectures covering the theory and methods, followed by
   application and computer exercises in given data sets. This often leads
   to challenges for students in comprehending fundamental statistical
   concepts essential for medical research. To address these challenges, we
   propose an engaging learning approach-DICE (design, interpret, compute,
   estimate)-aimed at enhancing the learning experience of statistics in
   public health and epidemiology. In introducing DICE, we guide readers
   through a practical example. Students will work in small groups to plan,
   generate, analyze, interpret, and communicate their own scientific
   investigation with simulations. With a focus on fundamental statistical
   concepts such as sampling variability, error probabilities, and the
   construction of statistical models, DICE offers a promising approach to
   learning how to combine substantive medical knowledge and statistical
   concepts. The materials in this paper, including the computer code, can
   be readily used as a hands-on tool for both teachers and students.},

Abstract = {Both society- and individual-level factors serve to make persistence
   through one's university career more difficult, especially for students

   not. Multivariate logistic regression and survival analysis are used to
   test for any statistical associations between SB participation and
   persistence while controlling for student demographic, high school
   background, and home area factors. Results suggest that while SB
   students come into college at a significant economic and academic
   disadvantage, they have 60\% higher odds of persisting to the second
   semester and 71\% higher odds of persisting to the second year than

Abstract = {Despite the substantial efforts made by higher education institutions to
   reduce dropout rates, a considerable proportion of students still
   discontinues their initial study program. In view of this situation, the
   present study aims to investigate whether participation in first-year
   courses for personal and academic support goes along with a decreased
   risk of student dropout, and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. We
   draw on data from the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS,
   student cohort) and apply mediation analysis based on event history
   models and linear regression models for students in the fields of
   mathematics/natural sciences and humanities. Our findings reveal that
   participation in social events for students in both subject groups and
   academic skills trainings for students in mathematics/ natural sciences
   is associated with a lower risk of student dropout, which is, partially,
   mediated by increased social integration. Attendants of bridging courses
   (often also referred to as summer bridge programs) do not have a lower
   risk of higher education dropout than students who did not participate.
   The results highlight the need for comprehensive evaluations of course
   effectiveness and a more frequently offering of academic skills
   trainings in STEM subjects.},

Title = {Dropout predictors in the academic fields of economics and engineering

   using cox regression},
Journal = {EMPIRICAL RESEARCH IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},

Month = {OCT 27},
Abstract = {Cooperative education programs are usually based on a partnership
   between companies and universities. Dropouts have a particular impact
   here, for example the loss of junior staff in the companies. Most
   dropouts in cooperative education occur in the first academic year. In
   this multicausal dropout process, the influence of the cooperation
   partner is less pronounced in research. Consequently, we shed light on
   perspectives of organizational commitment to the company and
   motivational aspects in the academic fields of economics and
   engineering. We analyze collected data using a cross-sectional study
   design and estimated cox regression analysis on 2263 first-year students
   at Baden-Wuerttemberg Cooperative State University (DHBW) in Germany
   with 149 dropouts. Our analysis presents associations between affective
   commitment to the company, relatedness and competence at the university,
   and demographic and performance control variables with dropping out.
   Findings are contextualized within the current state of research.
   Practical implications are discussed in our study.},

Title = {Progress in transforming a health sciences postgraduate cohort in a
   south african research-intensive institution, 2008-2017},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},

Abstract = {Background Equity redress in the higher education and health sectors is
   a global discourse that seeks to address the inequalities caused by past
   discrimination practices. The apartheid regime in South Africa
   fragmented both the higher education and the health sectors, creating
   White and male dominated systems. Consequently, Black Africans and
   females were under-represented in these sectors. Furthermore, the
   provision of higher education including medical training was unequal
   between the different populations. As democracy was established in South
   Africa in 1994, it is necessary to assess whether transformation in
   population affinity and sex of postgraduate students in the higher
   education and health sector has occurred, as these individuals are
   crucial for providing the future academic workforce and also healthcare
   to the public.
   Methods The demographic profile of postgraduate students graduating in a
   health sciences facility in South Africa over the period 2008-2017 was
   retrospectively assessed. Survival analysis models were used to
   investigate the time taken to graduate. Log-rank tests were used to
   compare the completion rates.
   Results More females (53.3\%) than males (41.9\%) completed their
   postgraduate degree over the period 2008-2017 (p(<)0.0001). In relation
   to population affinity, more White students (56.4\%) than Black African
   students (40.8\%) completed their degrees overall (p(<)0.0001).
   Conclusion While transformation occurred in the sex of graduating
   students over the ten year period, the same change has not occurred with
   regards to population affinity. The under-representation of Black
   African graduates is a major setback for efforts to diversify the South
   African higher education and health sectors. Transformation of the
   demographic profile of postgraduate students at South African
   institutions is vital for developing individuals who will contribute to
   equitable redress of academic staff in the higher education sector and
   also of the healthcare workforce. Diversified health personnel including
   highly skilled clinician scientists will aid in improving the provision
   of health care to communities particularly the underpriviledged rural
   areas, and also assist in training the next generation of healthcare
   staff. The challenges identified in this study may assist other
   countries where adequate transformation of the education and health
   sectors has not occurred.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the student dropout phenomenon in a technical
   Italian university from a time-to-event perspective. Shared frailty Cox
   time-dependent models are applied to analyse the careers of students
   enrolled in different engineering programs with the aim of identifying
   the determinants of student dropout through time, predicting the time to
   dropout as soon as possible and to observe how the dropout phenomenon
   varies across time and degree programs. The innovative contributions of
   this work are methodological and managerial. First, the adoption of
   shared frailty Cox models with time-varying covariates is relatively new
   to the student dropout literature and it allows to consider the student
   career evolution and the heterogeneity across degree programs. Second,
   understanding the dropout pattern over time and identifying the earliest
   moment for obtaining its accurate prediction allow policy makers to set
   timely interventions for students at risk of dropout.},

Abstract = {PurposeThe main purpose of this study is to evaluate the extent of
   dropout students and identify the relationship between risk factors of
   dropout and the survival time of students.Design/methodology/approachThe
   Kaplan-Meier estimator (KM), also known as the product-limit technique,
   is a nonparametric model function that is commonly used in estimating
   survival function events (Kaplan and Meier, 1958). The survival
   function's Kaplan-Meier estimators are used to estimate and graph
   survival probabilities as a function of time, as well as explanatory
   data analysis (EDA) for the survival data, including the median survival
   time, and compare for two or more of the survival events. In addition,
   Cox proportional hazards model is employed for modelling
   purpose.FindingsResults of the Kaplan-Meier curves show that male
   students have lower survival rates than female, researchers have found
   that there is a difference between the survival times of the student's
   school types, results show students from English-based schools are
   higher than Arabic-based schools as suggested by the survival curve.
   Similarly, there is a difference between the survival times of students
   aging equal or greater than 25 and students aging less than 25 and
   survival function estimates of dropout according to high school grade
   marks has huge difference. These results were confirmed using log rank
   test as age, school type and marks were statistically significantly
   different while gender is not statistically significant.Research
   limitations/implicationsThere is no study of this kind from the Somalia
   context about the student's dropout. Subsequent to the outbreak of civil
   war in 1988 and the collapse of the central government in 1991, all
   public social services in Somalia including education centers were
   severely disrupted.Originality/valueThe statistical methods discussed in
   the previous section will be applied on a real dataset obtained from
   different offices of the university; most of the data were extracted
   from faculty of economics office and admission and record office. The
   data set comprised of 70 students from SIMAD university, consists of
   full-time faculty of economics students who enrolled at the university
   in the academic year of 2017-2018 until two years of diploma, students
   either complete 24 months of diploma or leave the university and that is
   the event of interest.},

   survival analysis to investigate both the timing of staff turnover and
   the characteristics associated with turnover. The data were collected
   from over 2,000 teachers, assistant teachers and aides between 2007 and
   2019. Survival analysis allowed for investigation of both the timing of
   staff turnover and the time-varying and time-invariant characteristics
   associated with turnover. Over time, staff who were more positive about
   their work environment, had more years of teaching experience, taught in
   infant-toddler classrooms, or identified as Black were more likely to
   stay, whereas staff who had more years of education were more likely to
   leave. The probability of leaving was greatest in the first 2 to 3 years
   of employment. Some predictors of retention differed between lead
   teachers and assistants/aides, for example, the risk of leaving was
   greater for teachers with depressive symptoms but not for
   assistants/aides. While the results point to some areas where school
   leaders can effect practice changes to improve retention, the findings
   point to multiple areas where systemic and policy changes may be needed
   to reduce turnover.},

Abstract = {High dropout rates constitute a major concern for higher education
   institutions, due to their economic and academic impact. The problem is
   particularly relevant for institutions offering online courses, where
   withdrawal ratios are reported to be higher. Both the impact and these
   high rates motivate the implementation of interventions oriented to
   reduce course withdrawal and overall institutional dropout. In this
   paper, we address the identification of populations of learners at risk
   of withdrawing from higher education online courses. This identification
   is oriented to design interventions and is carried out using survival
   analysis. We demonstrate that the method's longitudinal approach is
   particularly suited for this purpose and provides a clear view of risk
   differences among learner populations. Additionally, the method
   quantifies the impact of underlying factors, either alone or in
   combination. Our practical implementation used an open dataset provided
   by The Open University. It includes data from more than 30,000 students
   enrolled in different courses. We conclude that low-income students and
   those who report a disability comprise risk groups and are thus feasible
   intervention targets. The survival curves also reveal differences among
   courses and show the detrimental effect of early dropout on low-income
   students, worsened throughout the course for disabled students.
   Intervention strategies are proposed as a result of these findings.
   Extending the entire refund period and giving greater academic support
   to students who report disability are two proposed strategies for
   reducing course withdrawal.},

   Learning and Survival Analysis Methods in the Latin American Context},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {The prediction of university dropout is a complex problem, given the
   number and diversity of variables involved. Therefore, different
   strategies are applied to understand this educational phenomenon,
   although the most outstanding derive from the joint application of
   statistical approaches and computational techniques based on machine
   learning. Student Dropout Prediction (SDP) is a challenging problem that
   can be addressed following various strategies. On the one hand, machine
   learning approaches formulate it as a classification task whose
   objective is to compute the probability of belonging to a class based on
   a specific feature vector that will help us to predict who will drop
   out. Alternatively, survival analysis techniques are applied in a
   time-varying context to predict when abandonment will occur. This work
   considered analytical mechanisms for supporting the decision-making
   process on higher education dropout. We evaluated different
   computational methods from both approaches for predicting who and when
   the dropout occurs and sought those with the most-consistent results.
   Moreover, our research employed a longitudinal dataset including
   demographic, socioeconomic, and academic information from six academic
   departments of a Latin American university over thirteen years. Finally,
   this study carried out an in-depth analysis, discusses how such
   variables influence estimating the level of risk of dropping out, and
   questions whether it occurs at the same magnitude or not according to
   the academic department, gender, socioeconomic group, and other
   variables.},

Abstract = {Over the past 40 years, global tertiary expansion has been driven in
   part by the rise of the non-university sector. The growth of this
   sector, which includes vocational colleges, also contributes to
   increasingly diverse national higher education systems. Prior research
   has focused on inter-state variation in national systems, while very few
   studies have explored intra-state variation in the expansion of
   non-university sector. Building on the policy innovation and diffusion
   model, this study uses event history analysis to investigate key drivers
   behind Chinese prefecture cities' adoption of vocational colleges during
   the latest tertiary education expansion. The study employs a rich panel
   dataset from 273 Chinese cities between 2000 and 2014. Findings suggest
   that the socioeconomic and the politico-institutional contexts matter
   the most for cities' policy adoption, and the influence of policy
   diffusion is negative but not significant. Moreover, there is
   substantial heterogeneity across time and region. The characteristics of
   early adopters significantly differ from those of late adopters, and the
   diffusion paths vary within and across regions. This study illustrates
   that the emergence of sub-national government affiliated non-university
   institutions is driven by a complex combination of socioeconomic,
   politico-institutional, and policy forces. Results highlight the
   regional contextual factors that may override coercive pressure from
   national strategies to promote the non-university sector expansion and
   the structural diversity in the context of less developed economies.},

   open university. Using survival analysis, we examined the effect of
   demographic information, past performance, and participation behaviors
   on student dropout patterns in the prophase, metaphase, and anaphase of
   online courses. Our results showed that the median retention time for
   online learners was 241 days. The Cox proportional hazard model results
   indicated that student past performance and participation behaviors were
   significant predictors of dropout. However, certain persistent
   participation behaviors (i.e. active days and assignment submission)
   tended to become less important in predicting dropout as the course
   progressed. Based on these findings, we provide recommendations for
   identifying at-risk students in a fully online environment.},

   Drawing on data from the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and other

   associated with efforts to establish a contingent faculty union at
   private, 4-year institu-tions. Even after accounting for other state and

   contingent faculty unionization at institutions located in states where
   the legislature is more liberal and where more contingent faculty union

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide.
   One of the chemotherapy agents, taxanes is important in increasing
   patients' survival. The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy
   of taxane-based drugs versus non-taxanes in neoadjuvant chemotherapy in
   non-metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma (GA) in Iranian patients.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a historical cohort method, 65 patients
   between 18 and 75 years old who suffered from non-metastatic GA were
   included. Nineteen and 21 and 25 patients, had undergone DCF (docetaxel,
   cisplatin, 5fluorouracil) and FLOT (5fluorouracil, leucovorin,
   oxaliplatin, docetaxel) and FOLFOX6 (oxaliplatin, leucovorin,
   5fluorouracil) regimens, respectively, between 2018 and 2021. Survival
   criteria consisting of progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival
   (OS), progression rate, and mortality rate were evaluated using the
   Kaplan-Meier method, in a three-year follow-up period.RESULTS: The
   majority of patients were male (72.3\%), with a median age of 65 years.
   Most of the patients had lesions with tumor, node, metastasis (TNM)
   stage IIIb (27.7\%) and poor differentiated pathological grade (49.2\%).
   OS time had a significant correlation with the low TNM stage (P = 0.01),
   well-differentiated pathological grade (P = 0.005), and FLOT vs. FOLFOX
   protocol (20.3 vs. 12.2 months, respectively. P =0.04). FLOT regimen had
   significantly better OS survival vs. DCF regimen (20.3 vs. 15.4 months,
   respectively, P = 0.03). No significant correlation was observed between
   survival criteria and other factors like gender, age, past medical
   history, Karnofsky scale, and tumor location in the stomach. The
   taxane-based arm (sum of DSF and FLOT) had no superiority over the
   non-taxane arm in survival criteria.CONCLUSION: FLOT protocol, as a
   taxane-based regimen had better survival compared to FOLFOX protocol in
   neoadjuvant chemotherapy in gastric non-metastatic adenocarcinoma.},

Journal = {COGENT EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {In Sub-Saharan African countries like Ethiopia, the waiting time for
   graduates before having their first job is very high. This study aimed
   at predicting the waiting time to get their first job and the effects of
   the associated factors. A retrospective study was conducted based on the
   2021 graduate tracer survey data at Wolkite University. By considering
   the complete information on the total of 2069 graduates, the accelerated
   failure time model was used to identify the different factors. The
   median waiting time to first employment for the graduates was 17 months.
   The Weibull accelerated failure time model was the most efficient model
   to examine the waiting time among other survival models. It revealed
   that graduates from all colleges had shorter waiting times when compared
   to colleges of agriculture and natural resource. Graduates who scored
   lower have been waiting longer to get their first employment when
   compared to the high scorer. Graduates who were from Amhara, Oromia,
   Tigray, and other regions have been waiting for about 1.30, 1.18, 1.93,
   and 1.38 times longer, respectively, compared to those who were from
   Addis Ababa. Also, graduates who search for a job through relations and
   others had shorter waiting times when compared to those searching
   through public advertisements. College of graduates, CGPA, region, ways
   of searching for a job, and numbers of applications were statistically
   significant factors identified. So considering these factors is vital to
   produce labor market-oriented professionals hired within a short time.},

Abstract = {Women in academia are typically outnumbered by men, a phenomenon

   by showing a motherhood penalty in the career pipeline at the

   information and an email survey, the paper examines which factors are
   associated with being awarded a habilitation and whether these factors
   differ between women and men as well as mothers and fathers. Using Cox
   regressions of retrospective career trajectories of almost all
   psychologists at German universities in 2019 (2527 scientists with
   37,423 publications), the study shows that SSCl/SCIE articles and having
   a PhD from abroad increase the habilitation risk more strongly for women
   and mothers than for men and fathers. Net of career factors observed by
   CVs, however, mothers have a 42\% significantly lower habilitation risk.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: In France, 3.2 million middle-school students have
   serious/persistent school difficulties and are re-engaged in
   adapted-general/vocational-education class (AGVEC), created to early
   re-engage them in school/professional projects. We assessed the AGVEC's
   benefits for school-behavior-health-related difficulties (SBHDs).
   METHODS: This population-based study compared 83 AGVEC students (mean
   age = 14.4 \& PLUSMN; 1.1) with 1559 regular-class students (mean age =
   13.5 \& PLUSMN; 1.3) from north-eastern France. They completed a
   questionnaire collecting socioeconomic features and SBHDs. The data were
   analyzed using logistic regression models and Kaplan-Meier estimates.
   RESULTS: The AGVEC students had similar academic performance but fewer
   school absences due to health problems, less sleep difficulty, fewer
   depressive symptoms, and more social support as compared with
   regular-class students: sex-age-class-level-adjusted odds ratio (saclOR)
   0.31-0.56 (p < 0.05/0.001). The AGVEC students had fewer skipping
   school, better health status, less sleep difficulty, fewer depressive
   symptoms, fewer suicide ideation/attempt, and more social support as
   compared with regular-class students with low academic performance:
   saclOR 0.22-0.52 (most with p < 0.01). Socioeconomic features played
   modest roles. The benefits for depressive symptoms and suicide attempt
   increased with age since age 10.
   CONCLUSIONS: Re-engagement in the AGVEC is particularly effective in
   reducing SBHDs.},

   scholarship program from survival models},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {96},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The Permanence Scholarship Program (PSP) is one of the main Brazilian
   student assistance policies, aiming to prevent low-income students from
   dropping out of higher education, by providing them with financial aid.
   This article analyzes the effects of PSP for students from private
   higher education institutions on the time of completion and rate of
   degree obtention. Survival analysis associated with propensity score
   matching was used, based on data from the higher education census
   between 2010 and 2017. Students included in the program, from the 4th
   year onwards, are at lower risk of evasion, have greater probability of
   graduation, and complete the studies in less time than those not in the
   program, even if it does not happen within the regulatory deadline.
   Academic scholarship holders, older and female students are more likely
   to complete the course. Therefore, the PSP fulfills its role in reducing
   dropout and time to graduation.},

Title = {A Bioinformatic Approach to Enhance Undergraduate Student Understanding

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CANCER EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {38},

Abstract = {Recent advances in tumor immunology and cancer immunotherapy have
   generated significant interest in the field of immuno-oncology. With the
   promise of these advances comes an increasing need to train the next
   generation of scientists who will support ongoing basic and clinical
   research efforts in this field. At this time, however, there remains a
   documented underrepresentation of tumor immunology as a core content
   area in many undergraduate science curricula. This study introduces a
   novel pedagogical strategy that aimed to promote undergraduate student
   interest in tumor immunology in ways that support recent education
   guidelines published by the American Association of Immunologists, and
   it highlights the efficacy of this approach in enhancing student
   understanding of concepts relevant to the Cancer-Immunity Cycle. Using
   RNA-sequencing data obtained from clinical specimens catalogued in The
   Cancer Genome Atlas, students performed Kaplan-Meier survival analyses
   to identify Cancer-Immunity Cycle genes with prognostic significance.
   After correlating expression of such genes with tumor-infiltrating
   immune cell populations using a bioinformatic tool to deconvolute whole
   tumor-transcriptome data, students undertook an exercise that requires
   integration of course content and findings from the primary literature
   to generate hypotheses about the influence of genetic factors and immune
   cell types on the Cancer-Immunity Cycle and overall patient outcome. A
   pre-/post-project assessment instrument demonstrated the efficacy of
   this approach as a means of improving undergraduate student
   understanding of core cancer immunology concepts. This report describes
   these data and discusses potential ways in which the project can be
   adapted to extend its utility to broad and diverse student populations.},

Title = {Demographic and psychological factors that predict retention in infant

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Home visiting programs are prominent prevention and intervention models
   that improve the well-being of infants, young children and their
   families who are at risk for negative outcomes. However, many home
   visiting programs struggle to retain families for the length of the
   intervention. We used survival analysis to examine the impact of
   demographic (e.g., education, socioeconomic status) and mental health
   concerns (e.g., maternal stress, therapist-rated mental health status)
   factors on the retention of 70 mothers in Infant Mental Health-Home
   Visiting (IMH-HV), a multi-faceted, needs-driven, relationship-focused
   psychotherapeutic home visiting model. The impact of both individual and
   cumulative factors on retention was examined. Results revealed that
   shorter retention in treatment was predicted by younger maternal age at
   the time of childbirth, lower levels of education, and an accumulation
   of demographic characteristics often reflecting structural inequalities.
   In contrast, mental health concerns, depression in particular, predicted
   longer retention. For each additional structural inequity, the risk of
   leaving treatment increased by 60\%. For each additional mental health
   concern, the risk of leaving treatment decreased by 25\%. The findings
   regarding structurally-driven inequities are consistent with much of the
   previous research. In contrast, the finding that those with a higher
   composite mental health score were more likely to remain in treatment
   longer than those with lower levels is counter to many studies. These
   results may be partially explained by the mental health and relational
   focus of the Michigan model of IMH-HV. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Journal = {RESEARCH IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {64},

Pages = {547-573},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {A primary focus among colleges implementing student success reforms has
   been to increase overall rates of completing any credential and to
   reduce racial and socioeconomic equity gaps in such completion rates.
   The focus on general completion may overlook inequities in the type of
   program students complete, which is particularly significant given the
   wide variety of credentials offered at community colleges and the
   resulting variation in labor market returns among completers. Our study
   examines racial/ethnic stratification among community college students
   as they enter and progress through programs leading to higher or lower
   opportunities in the labor market. Using a discrete-time survival
   analysis and longitudinal enrollment and transcript data. We track
   enrollment, completion, and transfer for up to 9 years. We also measure
   achievement of academic milestones (such as credit accrual) along
   educational pathways associated with higher rates of credential
   completion and transfer over the long term. Results suggest that a
   significant gap in the likelihood of bachelor's degree completion
   between Black and White students emerges episodically, while the gap
   between Hispanic and White students develops earlier and remains
   consistent over time. Results also suggest that, while all students
   generally benefit from attainment of academic milestones, doing so
   disproportionately benefits Black and Hispanic students.},

Title = {Understanding Waiting Time from Graduation to First Employment: Survival
   Analysis-Based Evidence from Ethiopia},
Journal = {EDUCATION RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {AUG 25},
Abstract = {Most students considered that having a university degree is sufficient
   to be employed. However, obtaining a job after graduation becomes
   challenging, especially in developing countries. As a result, some
   graduates have to wait a considerable amount of time to get their first
   job. We estimated the average waiting time for first employment for 2019
   first-degree graduates from Debre Markos University (Burie campus),
   Ethiopia. The median waiting time for the first employment of graduates
   was 35 weeks, showing that 50\% of graduates managed to secure their
   first job 35 weeks after graduation. In addition, Cox proportional
   hazard and log-normal accelerated failure time models were fitted to
   model waiting time for first employment with various factors. It was
   found that cumulative grade point average, gender, internship, and age
   of the graduates were significant factors that affect the waiting time
   for first employment of graduates. Finally, we documented that though
   cumulative grade point average is important to pass the first phase of
   elimination criteria, it is not the only metric that employers consider.},

Title = {Demography as Destiny: Explaining the Turnover of Alternatively
   Certified Mathematics Teachers in Hard-to-Staff Schools},
Journal = {TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {124},
Number = {4},
Pages = {35-64},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background: To stem the tide of teacher turnover and prevent shortages,
   teacher turnover interventions and policies often focus on new and
   novice teachers because evidence suggests that teacher turnover is
   particularly high among these teachers. In addition, researchers
   continue to investigate the root causes of the high teacher turnover
   observed in many low-income, high-minority schools and whether this is
   due more to school demographics or poor working conditions. Purpose:
   This article examines New York City Teaching Fellows (NYCTF) teachers'
   risk of leaving their first school in their first 9 years. It both
   describes the patterns in leaving and examines how school demographics
   and school climate predict these leaving patterns. Participants: The
   study follows 608 teachers: two cohorts of secondary mathematics NYCTF
   teachers who entered the classroom in New York City in 2006 or 2007.
   Research Design: This is a quantitative study of survey and retention
   data that were collected as part of a longitudinal research project on
   NYCTF mathematics teachers. Data Analysis: We use an event history
   analysis (including a life table and hazard function graphs) to describe
   patterns in teachers' timing of leaving their first school. We also use
   a discrete time hazard model to estimate the relative relationships
   between the predictors of interest (school demographics and school
   climate) and teacher turnover. Results: The findings from this study
   provide evidence against the general hypothesis in the field that
   teachers leave their first schools at the highest rate during their
   first 1 to 3 years. Second, we also found that the turnover of
   alternatively certified teachers who began in low-income, high-minority
   urban schools was driven by both student demographics and school climate
   conditions, including teacher collegiality and student behavior. Third,
   we found evidence to support our hypothesis that teachers' individual
   perceptions of their school environment are stronger drivers of their
   turnover compared with the perceptions of their colleagues. Conclusion:
   The results from this study add to our understanding about the timing of
   teacher turnover among secondary mathematics NYCTF teachers,
   illustrating that teacher turnover may remain higher later in beginning
   teachers' careers than currently assumed. This suggests that teachers in
   Years 3 to 5 in their careers may be good targets for supports. Our
   findings support the theory that improving school climate can help
   retain teachers but also provide a cautionary tale for a complete focus
   on school climate; stemming teacher turnover may require addressing
   larger economic forces (e.g., the global trend toward temporary work)
   and more insidious social forces, such as structural racism and
   inequality.},

Title = {How Do Curricular Design Changes Impact Computer Science Programs?: A
   Case Study at San Pablo Catholic University in Peru},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2022},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Computer science is a dynamic field of study that requires constant
   review and updating of the curricular designs in academic programs-in
   general, measuring the impact of plan changes has been little explored
   in the literature. In most cases, it focuses only on structuring its
   curricula, leaving aside several factors associated with important
   events or facts such as student dropout, retention, and inclusion.
   However, these features provide academic institutions with many
   opportunities to understand student performance and propose more
   effective preventive/corrective actions to avoid dropouts. This work
   focuses on the curricular changes' influence on student gender
   imbalance, socioeconomic provenance, and dropout. Specifically, we
   employ three different approaches for our analysis: (i) a longitudinal
   study of four curricula from informatics engineering to computer science
   transition at San Pablo Catholic University, (ii) an exploratory
   analysis for identifying essential features that determines the events
   mentioned above, and (iii) a survival analysis to estimate the
   probability that a student will stay (not dropout) before graduate, and
   calculate the average permanence time per curricula. Our analysis shows
   that the female student rates decreased, student rates from lower
   socioeconomic provenance increased, and the dropout rates were reduced
   with updates towards an internationally standardized curriculum. This is
   even strongly evidenced when the program changes its name. Finally, the
   set of techniques employed in this work composes a statistical mechanism
   that can be replicated/adapted to any other program in computer science
   aiming to extract valuable insights to support the decision-making
   process in educational institutions.},

   The Case of Undergraduates from Debre Markos University},
Journal = {EDUCATION RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL},

Abstract = {This study aimed to identify the factors that influence Debre Markos
   University bachelor degree graduates' transition duration from higher
   education to employment. A retrospective study design and a total of
   1448 undergraduates were considered in this study. Kaplan-Meier, Cox
   proportional hazard, and parametric accelerated failure time survival
   analysis were used to identify the factors that influence the duration
   of the job search of graduates. The best parametric model that could
   describe the duration of the job search to obtain the first job was
   chosen using the Akaike information criterion. As per the study, 50\% of
   graduates were able to get their first employment 18 months after
   graduation. The Weibull parametric accelerated failure time model
   performed better in predicting the time it takes for graduates to find
   their first job. College, cumulative grade point average, father
   education, graduate region, public advertisement, starting own business,
   and doing an internship during the study were found to be statistically
   significant indicators of the transition duration of the graduates to
   obtain the first job. Debre Markos University 2019 graduates had a
   longer period of unemployment. The institution should have a fully
   functioning career service office that provides job search training and
   connects students with employers.},

Title = {Investigating the risk factors for academic difficulties in the medical
   programme at a South African university},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},

Month = {MAR 28},
Abstract = {Background The National Benchmark Test (NBT) that determines academic
   readiness is widely used by Faculties as an additional measure to select
   students for the study of medicine. Despite this, many students continue
   to experience academic challenges that culminate in delayed graduation
   and sometimes academic exclusion or discontinuation of studies. Aim This
   study aimed to understand academic and non-academic variables linked
   with academic difficulties in the first three years of medical
   education. Methods The study sample consisted of six cohorts of medical
   students for the period 2011 to 2016 (n = 1392). Only the first three of
   the six-year medical programme were selected for analysis. Survival
   analysis and Cox Proportional Hazard (CPH) was used to identify academic
   and non-academic variables associated with academic difficulties.
   Results A total of 475 students (34\%) experienced academic difficulty;
   221 (16\%) in the first year of study, 192 (14\%) in the second year and
   62 (5\%) in the third year of study. The results show that Intermediate
   Upper, Lower and Basic levels for all NBT domains, living in university
   residence, rurality and male gender were risk factors for academic
   difficulty. Conclusion In mitigating these factors, the NBT must inform
   the type of support programmes to augment the students' skills and
   promote academic success. Additionally, existing support programmes
   should be evaluated to ascertain if they reach students at risk and
   whether participating in these programmes yield positive academic
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {Student attrition is a challenge for higher education institutions
   across the world. The purpose of this study was to examine the
   application of joint model using students' commutative grade point
   average and attrition status. A total of 258 college student samples
   were used in this study. A mixed effect model for students' grade point
   average and a Cox hazard model for students' attrition status were
   modeled independently, and both submodels were modeled jointly by
   linking random effects through a shared parameter model. This study
   focused on gender issues, academic background, peer support, and
   residence. From the finding of this study, 26.4\% were attrition, and
   73.6\% were retained. The estimated trend of commutative grade point
   average was found to be negatively associated with attrition status. The
   major factors that encounter students' attritions were academic
   background and institutional factors.},

Abstract = {In an ever-changing world, having the right competences for the job
   market represents a key challenge for sustained employability. To
   address this need a growing number of digital platform for life long
   learning (LLL) has been developed. Anyway, it is less known how users
   navigate and use these platforms. The present study represents a one of
   the first attempts to fill this gap, offering a deep analysis for the
   identification of latent subgroups of learners with similar behaviours
   on a digital LLL platform. Then, the identified subgroups are described
   in terms of personal features and survival profiles. Findings reveal
   three distictive latent classes, with very different survival profiles.
   The analysis provides interesting insights about how the administators
   of a digital LLL platform can better personalize their contents
   according to the type of learner, to support and let them stay on the
   platform, acquiring the needed skills for the job market.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delay in seeking medical help in patients with acute
   myocardial infarction (AMI) challenges the patients in terms of
   diagnosis and treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of
   delay referral (>= 12 h) in patients with AMI.\& nbsp;MATERIALS AND
   METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, the medical records of 252
   patients with AMI (2017-2019) admitted to Shahid Beheshti Hospital, Qom,
   Iran, was reviewed. Data collection tool was a researcher-made data
   sheet that included demographic characteristics, times, hospitalization
   costs, risk factors, history of heart disease, results of paraclinical
   tests, clinical information at the time of admission, and outcomes of
   delayed referral. Data were analyzed using t-test, Chi-square,
   Kaplan-Meier estimator, log-rank test, Cox regression by STATA, and SPSS
   (version 25).\& nbsp;RESULTS: The levels of troponin, creatine
   phosphokinase, lactate dehydrogenase were significantly higher in the
   delayed referral group (P < 0.05). After treatment, the cardiac ejection
   fraction was significantly different in the nondelayed referral (41.56
   +/- 9.16) and the delayed referral group (38.39 +/- 11.01) (P < 0.001).
   There was no significant difference in the percentage of hospital deaths
   in the groups (P = 0.078).\& nbsp;CONCLUSION: Delayed referral of
   patients with AMI is associated with decreased physiological cardiac
   function, which complicates recovery for these patients.},

Title = {Promoting priorities: Explaining the adoption of compulsory schooling

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {88},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This paper employs an event history analysis to examine the diffusion of
   compulsory schooling laws (CSLs) that require at least seven years of
   schooling throughout Africa. The current theory on CSL diffusion has
   been developed almost exclusively by studying patterns of adoption in
   the Western world. This paper tests reasons for diffusion that are
   prominent in this Western literature and adds additional predictors that
   are likely to better represent educational governance in Africa. The
   main finding from this paper is that adoption of seven-year CSLs in
   Africa can be predicted primarily through common linguistic and
   historical ties between countries, rather than through other variables
   that are theorized to be important from prior literature.},

Abstract = {The length of time that a swimmer frequents a particular sports
   facility, using the records held by the facilities have often been
   under-used. We examined various behavioral variables associated with
   time of attendance until the point of dropout using swimmers' records.
   6,749 swimmers were used in this study. The survival analysis focused on
   the time interval between the moment they became a customer until either
   the end of the study or the moment when the customer relationship ended
   (dropout). The Kaplan-Meier estimator was used to gather information as
   to when dropout would occur; Cox regression and the Logrank test
   provided statistical comparisons between the groups. The results showed
   that the swimmers' likelihood of retention beyond 12 months was 53\% and
   the median swimmer's survival time was 14 months. The cohort of
   customers signing up for more than two sessions per week was likely to
   stay longer, and the greater the number of visits, the longer the
   customers were likely to continue (> 40 visits increases the survival
   probability up to 91.86\%). Good sports management practice requires
   improvements in customer retention; by monitoring the variables of
   survival rates, we will improve management strategies for sustainability
   through pre-emptive actions to increase retention.},

Title = {Policy Diffusion of Performance Funding Equity Metrics: Traditional
   Neighbor and Dyadic Survival Analyses},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL POLICY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {37},
Number = {4},
Pages = {875-909},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {While previous research on higher education policy diffusion often
   conceptualizes diffusion as occuring across neighboring governments, we
   conceptualize policy diffusion as also occuring across pairs of
   governments (dyads) regardless of geographic proximity. We apply both
   conceptualizations and use survival analysis techniques to examine
   factors associated with state adoption of performance funding equity
   metrics. Results show that the proportion of neighbors with equity
   metrics is unrelated to the likelihood of adopting a metric for either
   the 2- or 4-year sector, suggesting no evidence of policy diffusion
   across borders. The directed dyad analysis reveals that states are less
   likely to adopt a 4-year metric when the other state in the pair already
   operates a 4-year metric, indicating that states look beyond neighbors
   in policy avoidance behaviors. Internal state factors such as higher
   levels of legislative professionalism and greater enrollment of
   underrepresented minority and low-income students increase the
   likelihood of policy adoption. A state is less likely to imitate the
   adoption of 2-year equity metrics in another state when the pair show
   greater differences in legislative professionalism, minority and
   low-income student enrollment, income per capita, and income inequality.
   Our research highlights the utility of quantitatively modeling policy
   diffusion across governmental units that are distantly located,
   especially for higher education policy components that are nationally
   visible.},

Title = {Competing Alternatives: Science and Math Identity Recognition and Credit
   Accrual in the Trajectory of STEM Major Plans},

Abstract = {It is estimated that over a third of college students switch majors at
   least once (Astorne-Figari \& Speer, Economics of Education Review
   70:75-93, 2019), but the impact of this switching behavior on students'
   pathways towards a science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM)
   degree are not well understood. In this study, using panel data from the
   Pathways through College Research Network, we explore how initial
   science identity-related beliefs about math and science recognition
   relate to students' STEM major plans over time- that is are students
   more likely to maintain their plan, switch among STEM majors, or leave
   STEM fields altogether? We account for students' motivational beliefs in
   pursuing STEM, their experiences of high-impact practices on campus, and
   the ``additive effect{''} of credit accrual on persistence and
   maintaining aspirations. Using competing risk event history analysis, we
   test influential factors in the decision to leave a STEM major or switch
   among STEM majors in the first three years of undergraduate education at
   three institutions (n = 518). We observe that credit accrual was
   significantly related to lower odds of students either leaving or
   switching, and that different forms of science and math recognition
   predict significant differences in odds of switching among and leaving
   STEM majors. We observe significantly different sets of influences on
   switching and leaving behaviors which suggests that students who depart
   STEM might be fundamentally different from students who switch among
   fields, but who do not stay in their original field of interest.},

Abstract = {The disengagement that leads to school dropout may start as early as
   middle school, but may be interrupted by motivational interventions. One
   approach is to promote the relevance of content through explanations and
   demonstrations of the value of this content to students' futures.
   CareerStart is an intervention that provides teachers prepackaged
   lessons for middle school math, English language arts, science, and
   social studies, which connects content in these courses to jobs and
   careers. In this study, we use data from a randomized control trial to
   report on the impact of CareerStart and career relevant lessons on
   preventing later drop-out. Event history analysis shows that CareerStart
   reduced the hazard of drop-out by 23\%, and that at the school level, 10
   CareerStart lessons was associated with a reduction of 1\%. Students who
   did not change schools experienced the greatest benefit. We discuss
   implications for practice and research and suggest next steps.},

Abstract = {Drawing from resource dependence theory, this study explores the extent
   to which international student enrollment related to institutional
   decisions to shift to in-person instructional strategies during the
   COVID-19 pandemic. We focus our study particularly on July 2020, a time
   during which tensions around international students' legal status in the
   US were especially high. Our results suggest that leaders at private
   not-for-profit institutions were significantly more likely to shift
   instructional strategies to include more in-person instruction, thus
   allowing more international students to enroll but also placing at risk
   the health of individuals on their campuses and in their local
   communities. A similar result was not found for public institutions.
   These results speak to the extent to which private institutions in the
   US have become financially dependent on international students' tuition
   and have clear implications for the financial futures of US higher
   education institutions.},

Title = {Is Academic Attainment or Situational Judgment Test Performance in
   Medical School Associated With the Likelihood of Disciplinary Action? A
   National Retrospective Cohort Study},
Journal = {ACADEMIC MEDICINE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {96},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1467-1475},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Purpose Disciplinary action imposed on physicians indicates their
   fitness to practice medicine is impaired and patient safety is
   potentially at risk. This national retrospective cohort study sought to
   examine whether there was an association between academic attainment or
   performance on a situational judgment test (SJT) in medical school and
   the risk of receiving disciplinary action within the first 5 years of
   professional practice in the United Kingdom. Method The authors included
   data from the UK Medical Education Database for 34,865 physicians from
   33 U.K. medical schools that started the UK Foundation Programme
   (similar to internship) between 2014 and 2018. They analyzed data from 2
   undergraduate medical assessments used in the United Kingdom: the
   Educational Performance Measure (EPM), which is based on academic
   attainment, and SJT, which is an assessment of professional attributes.
   The authors calculated hazard ratios (HRs) for EPM and SJT scores.
   Results The overall rate of disciplinary action was low (65/34,865,
   0.19\%) and the mean time to discipline was 810 days (standard deviation
   {[}SD] = 440). None of the physicians with fitness to practice concerns
   identified as students went on to receive disciplinary action after they
   qualified as physicians. The multivariate survival analysis demonstrated
   that a score increase of 1 SD (approximately 7.6 percentage points) on
   the EPM reduced the hazard of disciplinary action by approximately 50\%
   (HR = 0.51; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 0.38, 0.69; P < .001).
   There was not a statistically significant association between the SJT
   score and the hazard of disciplinary action (HR = 0.84; 95\% CI: 0.62,
   1.13; P = .24). Conclusions An increase in EPM score was significantly
   associated with a reduced hazard of disciplinary action, whereas
   performance on the SJT was not. Early identification of increased risk
   of disciplinary action may provide an opportunity for remediation and
   avoidance of patient harm.},

Title = {Breaking Stereotypes About Alumni Donors: Who Gives First? A
   Discrete-Time Hazard Model},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {93},
Number = {2},
Pages = {220-247},
Month = {FEB 23},
Abstract = {Institutions of higher education are relying on philanthropy and
   fundraising at a greater level than ever before seen. This increased
   focus has led scholars to investigate various predictors regarding which
   alumni are likely to give and which are likely to give the most. To
   date, however, scholars have not yet examined the role of timing and
   when alumni give their first gift to their alma mater. Using
   discrete-time hazard modeling (DTHM), this paper seeks to re-center the
   current conversation surrounding educational philanthropy by exploring
   not simply who gives the most, but rather who gives and when. Using data
   of alumni from a predominantly White, private-research university in the
   United States (n = 3,404), we find that those alumni who were in
   cultural clubs, as well as Black and multi-racial alumni, are more
   likely to give their first gift at an earlier date than other alumni.
   Additionally, alumni that participated in fewer student activities while
   at school appear more likely to give their first gift sooner, while
   gender, income, and alumni activity participation show no significance
   in the model. This study upends some commonly held stereotypes of who
   are donors to higher education. We share implications for practice and
   future research.},

Title = {The longitudinal trajectories of online engagement over a full program},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {175},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Student engagement has a trajectory (a timeline) that unfolds over time
   and can be shaped by different factors including learners' motivation,
   school conditions, and the nature of learning tasks. Such factors may
   result in either a stable, declining or fluctuating engagement
   trajectory. While research on online engagement is abundant, most
   authors have examined student engagement in a single course or two.
   Little research has been devoted to studying online longitudinal
   engagement, i.e., the evolution of student engagement over a full
   educational program. This learning analytics study examines the
   engagement states (sequences, successions, stability, and transitions)
   of 106 students in 1396 course enrollments over a full program. All data
   of students enrolled in the academic year 2014-2015, and their
   subsequent data in 2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018 (15 courses) were
   collected. The engagement states were clustered using Hidden Markov
   Models (HMM) to uncover the hidden engagement trajectories which
   resulted in a mostly-engaged (33\% of students), an intermediate
   (39.6\%), and a troubled (27.4\%) trajectory. The mostly-engaged
   trajectory was stable with infrequent changes, scored the highest, and
   was less likely to drop out. The troubled trajectory showed early
   disengagement, frequent dropouts and scored the lowest grades. The
   results of our study show how to identify early program disengagement
   (activities within the third decile) and when students may drop out
   (first year and early second year).},

Title = {The impact of a faculty development program, the Leadership in Academic

Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},

Abstract = {Background Academic medical centers invest considerably in faculty
   development efforts to support the career success and promotion of their
   faculty, and to minimize faculty attrition. This study evaluated the
   impact of a faculty development program called the Leadership in
   Academic Medicine Program (LAMP) on participants' (1) self-ratings of
   efficacy, (2) promotion in academic rank, and (3) institutional
   retention. Method Participants from the 2013-2020 LAMP cohorts were
   surveyed pre and post program to assess their level of agreement with
   statements that spanned domains of self-awareness, self-efficacy,
   satisfaction with work and work environment. Pre and post responses were
   compared using McNemar's tests. Changes in scores across gender were
   compared using Wilcoxon Rank Sum/Mann-Whitney tests. LAMP participants
   were matched to nonparticipant controls by gender, rank, department, and
   time of hire to compare promotions in academic rank and departures from
   the organization. Kaplan Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards
   models were used to examine differences. Results There were significant
   improvements in almost all self-ratings on program surveys (p < 0.05).
   Greatest improvements were seen in ``understand the promotions
   process{''} (36\% vs. 94\%), ``comfortable negotiating{''} (35\% vs.
   74\%), and ``time management{''} (55\% vs. 92\%). There were no
   statistically significant differences in improvements by gender, however
   women faculty rated themselves lower on all pre-program items compared
   to men. There was significant difference found in time-to-next promotion
   (p = 0.003) between LAMP participants and controls. Kaplan-Meier
   analysis demonstrated that LAMP faculty achieved next promotion more
   often and faster than controls. Cox-proportional-hazards analyses found
   that LAMP faculty were 61\% more likely to be promoted than controls
   (hazard ratio {[}HR] 1.61, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 1.16-2.23,
   p-value = 0.004). There was significant difference found in
   time-to-departure (p < 0.0001) with LAMP faculty retained more often and
   for longer periods. LAMP faculty were 77\% less likely to leave compared
   to controls (HR 0.23, 95\% CI 0.16-0.34, p < 0.0001). Conclusions LAMP
   is an effective faculty development program as measured subjectively by
   participant self-ratings and objectively through comparative
   improvements in academic promotions and institutional retention.},

Abstract = {The retention of students is a challenge faced by many universities in
   countries where participation rates are high. Living learning
   communities (LLCs) have been adopted by college administrators to
   increase retention, even though evidence of their effectiveness is
   largely anecdotal. This paper uses propensity score matching to address
   selection bias and identify the causal effect of an LLC program on GPA
   and retention. Survival analysis (of the matched sample) is used to
   estimate retention over time. Results suggest that the LLC program has a
   positive and lasting effect on retention and a positive impact on GPA in
   the earlier college years.},

Abstract = {The learning effectiveness of video lectures has been extensively
   studied by the scientific community, but research on their
   cost-effectiveness and sustainable production is still very scarce. To
   shed light on these aspects, this study has measured the useful life
   span and cost-effectiveness of a large catalog of video lectures
   produced for undergraduate courses at a Spanish university. A
   Kaplan-Meier survival analysis has been performed to identify factors
   linked to video longevity. The analysis accounted for variables such as
   the video production style (screencast, slideshow, chalk and talk,
   talking head, and onlocation film) and others such as the instructional
   purpose and field of knowledge. The teachers involved in video
   production and integration have been surveyed to discover causes of
   video obsolescence. In addition, using life span and production cost
   data, the cost-effectiveness of each production style over time was
   estimated. The results suggest that production style affects video
   longevity, and in particular, dynamic visuals are more related to longer
   life spans compared with static contents. Screencast stands out as the
   most cost-effective production style, having the best ratio of life span
   to production effort. Some practical suggestions are provided for
   producing video lectures with higher longevity expectations.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUL 5},
Abstract = {Disparities in undergraduate STEM degree completion across different
   racial/ethnic groups have been a topic of increasing national concern.
   This study investigates the long-term outcomes of a STEM intervention
   program designed to increase the academic preparation, achievement and
   persistence of under-represented minority students.In particular, this
   study examines the extent to which participation in a STEM intervention
   program can impact the long-term persistence and graduation of
   first-time in college under-represented minority students. Using
   discrete-time competing risks analysis, results demonstrated that
   participants of the intervention program had a lower probability of drop
   out and higher probability of persisting in a STEM field of study
   compared to non-participants of the program. Additionally, descriptive
   results demonstrated that participants of the STEM intervention program
   had higher rates of graduation in any field compared to non-participants
   of the program, while program participation was not a significant
   predictor of six-year graduation. Findings highlight the importance of
   early academic preparation in Calculus and total credit accumulation to
   student success outcomes of URM students enrolled in STEM fields.
   Recommendations from this study focus on early intervention efforts,
   particularly in the areas of mathematics, that ensure URM students are
   adequately prepared with the skills needed to succeed in a STEM field of
   study.},

Title = {An Experimental Model to Induce Homogeneous and Progressive Pulmonary
   Fibrosis in Rats},
Journal = {INDIAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION AND RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {55},

Abstract = {Background: This study aims to develop a new experimental model of
   pulmonary fibrosis (PF) as an alternative to conventional bleomycin
   model to overcome its limitations and effectively screened the
   therapeutic agents. Similarity of new experimental model to human lung
   fibrosis particularly as uniform and continuous progression has
   encouraged us to evaluate the usefulness of this system by assessment of
   anti-fibrotic drug pirfenidone parallel with bleomycin induced PF.
   Materials and Methods: In new model, ovalbumin (OVA) related asthma
   induced rats were set to inhaled nebulized formaldehyde solution (0.5\%
   v/v, 30 min) subsequent with cigarettes smoke exposure twice daily for
   14, 28 or 42 days and designated as AFC treated rats. However, bleomycin
   (BLM) treated rats were administered (5 IU/kg) single dose intratracheal
   injection. The pulmonary associated effects were assessed through cells
   permeation study, biochemical evaluation, physical and physiological
   parameters, survival analysis and histopathological examination.
   Results: Overall, pulmonary associated effects induced by new as well as
   conventional bleomycin model exhibited almost similar results. Though,
   new model developed homogeneous and time dependent advancement in
   pulmonary severity with enhanced survival ratio as compared to bleomycin
   model. Comparatively, new model also represented low extent of
   normalization with pirfenidone treatment due to establishment of
   progressive fibrosis. Conclusion: This study reflects the role of
   formaldehyde and cigarette smoke in reinforcement of PF particularly
   during the lung inflammatory condition. Also, it provides novel idea to
   induce homogeneous and progressive PF in rats, which could resembles
   human lung fibrosis more specifically than conventionally induced by
   intratracheal bleomycin instillation.},

   by Age and Gender},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Undergraduate college-going is now undertaken well into adulthood, but
   knowledge about what leads individuals to enroll derives nearly entirely
   from the study of the ``traditionally-aged{''}. I examine whether and
   how predictors of enrollment vary as individuals progress through the
   life-course using nationally representative data from the United States,
   following a cohort from ages 18-45. Measures of social background and
   academic preparation are only weakly predictive beyond age 24, while the
   effects of gender are largest after age 35. Marriage appears to be a
   barrier to enrollment among males and females, but only until age 25.
   Involuntary job loss spurs college-going most strongly among those aged
   35 or older, and particularly among women. Among those over age 25,
   marital dissolution predicts enrollment positively among females but
   negatively among males.},

   doctoral education in Germany},
Journal = {HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {82},
Number = {5},
Pages = {937-958},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Despite the benefits of a PhD for degree-holders as well for society as
   a whole, doctoral student attrition is a common phenomenon.
   Unfortunately, the empirical literature on dropout from doctoral
   education is scant, especially for non-US countries-an omission we
   address in the current study. Building on Tinto's model of student
   attrition and rational choice theory, the study empirically assesses the
   association of different individual, institutional, and external factors
   with the propensity to leave doctoral studies. Unlike most studies in
   the field, it draws on longitudinal data using event history modelling,
   observing doctoral students in multiple disciplines and a wide range of
   universities. The key results can be summarized as follows: In Germany,
   women are more likely to dropout than men. The probability of dropping
   out strongly depends on the discipline and the availability of a
   scholarship. A close contact with the supervisor and exchange with other
   PhDs are associated with a lower dropout probability. Moreover, having
   children increases dropout rates. The study findings provide first
   empirical guidance for interventions that can possibly help reducing
   dropout.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Despite the large literature on teacher labor market in the United

   teachers and the factors that affect their decisions to return to the
   profession. This is surprising given that former teachers represent over
   a third of teachers entering the teaching workforce, according to some
   estimates. This paper examines the exit and re-entry decisions of former
   teachers using a restricted-use data from the Beginning Teacher
   Longitudinal Study (BTLS). We use a discrete time hazard model that
   estimates the probability that a former teacher returns to teaching in a
   given year conditional on not having returned in the previous year.
   Results suggest that female teachers are more likely to return to the
   teaching profession by somewhere between 10 and 12 percentage points. We
   also find that teachers who are highly paid are more likely to re-enter
   teaching.},

Abstract = {Difficulties in processing emotional facial expressions is considered a
   central characteristic of children with autism spectrum condition (ASC).
   In addition, there is a growing interest in the use of virtual avatars
   capable of expressing emotions as an intervention aimed at improving the
   social skills of these individuals. One potential use of avatars is that
   they could enhance facial recognition and guide attention. However, this
   aspect needs further investigation. The aim of our study is to assess
   differences in eye gaze processes in children with ASC when they see
   avatar faces expressing emotions compared to real faces. Eye-tracking
   methodology was used to compare the performance of children with ASC
   between avatar and real faces. A repeated-measures general linear model
   was adopted to understand which characteristics of the stimuli could
   influence the stimuli's fixation times. Survival analysis was performed
   to understand differences in exploration behaviour between avatar and
   real faces. Differences between emotion recognition accuracy and the
   number of fixations were evaluated through a paired t-test. Our results
   confirm that children with autism have higher capacities to process and
   recognize emotions when these are presented by avatar faces. Children
   with autism are more attracted to the mouth or the eyes depending on the
   stimulus type (avatar or real) and the emotion expressed by the
   stimulus. Also, they are more attracted to avatar faces expressing
   negative emotions (anger and sadness), and to real faces expressing
   surprise. Differences were not found regarding happiness. Finally, they
   show a higher degree of exploration of avatar faces. All these elements,
   such as interest in the avatar and reduced attention to the eyes, can
   offer important elements in planning an efficient intervention.},

Abstract = {We used pupil-level data from the National Pupil Database in England to
   conduct a longitudinal analysis of the identification of moderate
   learning difficulties (MLD) and social, emotional, and mental health
   difficulties (SEMH) among 550,000 pupils ages 5 to 11 years. Survival
   analysis was used to determine the hazard ratios (HRs) for time to first
   identification, controlling for prior attainment and social-emotional
   development at age 5 as well as socioeconomic variables. For MLD, the
   overrepresentation of Black Caribbean and Pakistani pupils compared with
   White British pupils was eliminated following age 5 controls, and the
   predominant picture was of ethnic-minority underrepresentation. For
   SEMH, Black Caribbean and mixed White and Black Caribbean (MWBC) pupils
   continued to be overrepresented even after age 5 controls (HR = 1.36 and
   1.44, respectively), although this was not true for the larger group of
   Black African pupils, who were underrepresented in the adjusted analyses
   (HR = 0.62), as were most other ethnic-minority groups. The results
   indicate most ethnic-minority groups are underrepresented for special
   educational needs after adjusting for pupil characteristics on entry to
   school, though this varies by ethnic group and type of need.},

Title = {Keeping Up With the Joneses: District Adoption of the 4-Day School Week
   in Rural Missouri},
Journal = {AERA OPEN},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In recent years, rural school district adoption of 4-day school weeks
   has grown markedly. Despite this rapid growth, scant empirical evidence
   has documented the factors associated with district adoption and
   subsequent effects on student, labor, and economic outcomes. We examine
   the spread of the 4-day school week in rural Missouri, where over 10\%
   of the state's districts have adopted the policy in the past decade, the
   majority over the past 2 years. To help policymakers understand why
   districts forgo a day of instruction and to contextualize postpolicy
   effects, we conduct a survival analysis to assess student, district, and
   staff characteristics associated with policy adoption. We find that the
   presence of nearby 4-day school week districts most strongly predicts
   policy adoption. Adopting districts typically offer lower teacher
   salaries than nearby districts and have declining student enrollments.
   Our findings may inform policy focused on teacher recruitment and
   retention in rural locales.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Over the last four decades, the number of universities in Chile has
   increased dramatically (from eight to more than 50), along with the
   total enrollment of students (from 100,000 to 670,000 approximately).
   University presidents have played an increasingly important and complex
   role in this process. Meanwhile, understanding what happens at the very
   top of universities and who governs them is long overdue. Thus far, no
   study has attempted to understand what drives university presidents'
   survival in Chile. Drawing on scholarship on university presidents'
   turnover and on presidential survival from political science, we
   approach universities as political entities in which actors compete for
   power and office. Using an original dataset, we quantitatively analyze
   236 presidents from 60 different Chilean universities between 1990 and
   2019 to determine why some presidents stay in office while other
   involuntarily steps down. Our results show that survival is chiefly
   explained by the university's level of institutionalization
   (accreditation and year of foundation), whether it is public
   (state-owned) or private, and the frequency of street protests against
   presidents.},

Abstract = {In Japan, the number of beauty salons has been increased and reached
   over 250,000 at the end of 2018. On the other hand, there are some salon
   management problems such as price reduction and customer decrease. In
   such situations, it is an important not only to serve salon services,
   but to promote private brand (PB) items in addition to treatments. In
   this study, we analyzed purchase interval of PB items and predicted the
   purchase in a hair salon chain. First, we created explanatory variables
   using ID-POS data of the hair salon chain. Secondly, we selected
   explanatory variables using Cox proportional hazard model. Then, we
   performed Bayesian survival analysis to evaluate purchase interval
   considering customers' heterogeneity. As a result, we could grasp
   appropriate timing when customers had highly purchase motivation and
   applied marketing measures to effective promotion.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we explore a kind of teaching-oriented temporal analytics
   on the timing of support in the context of one-on-one math
   problem-solving coaching. We build the analytical framework upon the
   human-human multimodal interaction data collected from the naturalist
   environments. We demonstrated the potential utility of leveraging
   survival analysis, a class of statistical methods to model time-to-event
   data, to gain insights into the timing decisions. We shed light on the
   heterogeneity of coaching decisions as to when to render support in
   connection to the problem-solving stages, coaching dyads, as well as the
   pre-intervention event characteristics. This work opens future avenues
   into a different type of human tutoring study supported by multimodal
   data, computational models, and statistical frameworks. This model
   framework may yield useful reflective teaching analytics to tutors,
   coaches, or teachers when further developed. We also envision that those
   analyses may ultimately inform the design of AI-supported autonomous
   agents that could learn the tutorial interaction logic from empirical
   data.},

Abstract = {In multi-event survival analysis, one aims to predict the probability of
   multiple different events occurring over some time horizon. One
   typically assumes that the timing of events is drawn from some
   distribution conditioned on an individual's covariates. However, during
   training, one does not have access to this distribution, and the natural
   variation in the observed event times makes the task of survival
   prediction challenging, on top of the potential interdependence among
   events. To address this issue, we introduce a novel approach for
   multi-event survival analysis that models the probability of event
   occurrence hierarchically at different time scales, using coarse
   predictions (e.g., monthly predictions) to iteratively guide predictions
   at finer and finer grained time scales (e.g., daily predictions). We
   evaluate the proposed approach across several publicly available
   datasets in terms of both intra-event, inter-individual (global) and
   intra-individual, inter-event (local) consistency. We show that the
   proposed method consistently outperforms well-accepted and commonly used
   approaches to multi-event survival analysis. When estimating survival
   curves for Alzheimer's disease and mortality, our approach achieves a
   C-index of 0.91 (95\% CI 0.88-0.93) and a local consistency score of
   0.97 (95\% CI 0.94-0.98) compared to a C-index of 0.75 (95\% CI
   0.70-0.80) and a local consistency score of 0.94 (95\% CI 0.91-0.97)
   when modeling each event separately. Overall, our approach improves the
   accuracy of survival predictions by iteratively reducing the original
   task to a set of nested, simpler subtasks.},

Title = {Community College Study Abroad: An Event History Analysis},
Journal = {COMMUNITY COLLEGE REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {49},

Pages = {107-130},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study is twofold. First, this study
   explores individual student characteristics, specifically those related
   to demographics, financial need, academic characteristics, and social
   and cultural capitals, related to study abroad participation among
   community college students. Second, this study identifies when over the
   course of their studies community college students are most likely to
   participate in study abroad. Method: Data consist of student records
   provided by a large community college located in the U.S. Southeast. An
   event history model was used to estimate the relationship between both
   time-variant and time-invariant student-level indicators and study
   abroad participation. Smoothed hazard estimates were extracted from this
   model to explore the likelihood of study abroad participation over time.
   Results: Findings indicate that race/ethnicity, gender, state-residency
   status, age, need-based aid eligibility, field of study, and enrollment
   status (full- or part-time) significantly predicted study abroad
   participation. These results at times stand in contrast with findings
   from the literature on study abroad participation among students in the
   4-year sector. Smoothed hazard estimates indicated that community
   college students were more likely to study abroad the longer they were
   enrolled at the community college. Contributions: These results speak to
   ways in which community college students access capital resources to
   promote participation in study abroad and highlight unique aspects of
   community college study abroad programming. Results also provide a
   foundation for recommendations for practice that would serve to open
   access to education abroad at community colleges.},

Abstract = {On e-learning platforms, most e-learners didn't complete the course
   successfully. It means that reducing dropout is a critical problem for
   the sustainability of e-learning. This paper aims to establish a
   predictive model to describe e-learners' dropout behavior, which can
   help the commercial e-learning platforms to make appropriate
   interventions and incentives. First of all, we defined the features of
   unusual learning behaviors in commercial e-learning platform, and used
   the Cox proportional hazard model of survival analysis to select
   variables that can reasonably predict dropout possibilities. Results
   show that there are six variables which have significant influence on
   dropout behavior: dropout history, number of watched videos, number of
   progress bar operation, number of test questions operation, number of
   weeks that the login frequency is higher than average, and payment
   status. We also proposed cumulative gain, predicted retention number and
   predicted dropout learner number in next period, to evaluate the
   application ability of the predictive model. Finally, we performed an
   empirical analysis and verified the predictive effectiveness. The
   further application of the predictive model also shows that it can help
   the managers of e-learning platforms to adjust their strategy to improve
   the retention rate of potential lost learners.},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {22},

Abstract = {Despite concerted efforts to increase participation in advanced
   placement (AP) and dual credit (DC) programs, their efficacy remains
   unexplored. Drawing upon St. John's model as the conceptual framework,
   this study employed a discrete-time event history analysis to examine
   the interplay between forms of financial aid and persistence toward
   degree completion for students participating in DC and AP programs and
   enrolling in a large, multicampus, Midwestern, U.S. University.
   First-time, first-year baccalaureate degree-seeking students who began
   studies in Fall 2012 were tracked for 4 years. The findings suggest that
   many factors are significantly related to college success, including
   student demographics such as race (especially Latino identity),
   first-generation status, housing status, socioeconomic status, and
   dependency status; high school performance, AP/DC participation, and SAT
   or ACT scores; and financial aid, such as Pell and federal grant aid and
   institutional grant programs. Results suggest that receiving Pell and
   federal grant aid and institutional grant-in-aid consistently and
   significantly attenuated the risks of student departure. In relation to
   prematriculation college-level credits, AP participants were more likely
   to receive institutional grant programs, whereas DC participants were
   more likely to have student loans. These findings have implications
   regarding the efficacy of DC/AP programs in regard to their interplay
   with financial aid systems in affecting persistence outcomes.},

Abstract = {Over the past few decades, we have witnessed a surge in publicly funded

   legislative professionalism, and unemployment rates are associated with
   pre-K adoption; regional proximity to previously adopting states is also
   significant. The authors discuss implications for policy makers and
   advocates considering future legislative action in the early childhood

Abstract = {Reducing dropout rates is a major issue in Cambodia. This study examined
   the effects of school-level and student-level factors on dropout in
   rural Cambodian primary schools. We collected data of the same students
   over 3 years by visiting the same school. We used questionnaires for
   students and parents, checklists of school facilities, checklists of
   teacher characteristics and Khmer language and mathematics tests
   achievement as research tools. We found that the effect size of the
   school was small: students who dropped out had similar characteristics -
   even when dropout rates varied among schools. At the school level,
   teacher absence in both cohorts, mean interaction with teachers in
   higher-grade cohorts, and mean test achievement in lower-grade cohorts
   were significantly associated with dropout. At the student level, age at
   first school entry in both cohorts were significantly associated with
   dropout. In cohort 1, gender, relative achievement in class, parental
   educational attainment, economic status, parents' educational
   aspiration, and school distance were related to dropout. In cohort 2,
   repetition experience, absence, educational aspiration, teacher
   interaction, living with parents, and time spent helping the family were
   related to dropout. Reducing teacher absence and late school entry were
   key factors of preventing from dropping out of school.},

Abstract = {Low birth weight (LBW) and prematurity have been identified as health
   risks associated with adverse developmental and educational outcomes.
   This study examined whether such risks affected children's receiving

   from the Pre-Elementary Educational Longitudinal Study, we investigated
   how LBW and prematurity affected the time when children's health and
   developmental concerns were raised and when children received special
   education services, respectively, using survival analysis. We also
   estimated the timing of special education services after identification
   of health and development concerns. Findings indicated that LBW and
   prematurity did not affect the time when children's developmental
   concerns were raised. However, they significantly predicted children's
   receiving earlier special education services. Specifically, after
   children's health and developmental concerns being initiated, those born
   prematurely appeared to receive services earlier at any given point of
   time. Implications of early detection and intervention services for
   these children are discussed.},

Abstract = {This article employs event history analysis to explore the factors that

   influence of intermediary organizations. Although RTTT clearly played a
   role in state adoption, our analysis suggests that having a large

   predictor of state adoption. Intermediary organizations appeared to play

Abstract = {Inclusion and diversity are highly visible priorities at many colleges
   and universities. Efforts to diversify the professoriate have
   necessitated a better understanding of career outcomes for current
   female faculty and faculty of color. We measure risk of leaving without
   tenure and years to promotion from associate to full professor at four
   large land grant universities. We model career outcomes as competing
   risks, and compute cumulative incidence functions to discern differences
   in tenure and promotion outcomes by gender and race. We find incidence
   rates vary significantly by academic discipline, and in many instances,
   show larger effects than gender and racial or ethnic differences. Our
   examination also indicates that in particular academic fields, females
   are more prone to leave without tenure, and less likely to be promoted
   to full professor. We also find that racial or ethnic minorities are

Journal = {TEACHING AND TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {94},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This study extends the literature on teacher persistence by addressing
   teacher-job fit, defined as the degree to which a teacher possesses a
   core set of skills and related dispositions associated with the nature
   of the teaching profession. The sample includes 426 teachers hired out
   of a pool of 6207 applicants in a large suburban district. Cox
   regression estimates indicate that the risk of migrating out of the
   district is reduced by concern with equity and respect for others and by
   cultural sensitivity. Risk of attrition from the occupation is reduced
   by task orientation but is increased by effective communication. (C)

Abstract = {The objective of this work was to determine the student profile with the
   highest dropout at ITESO university in undergraduate programs of nine

   applying the Kaplan-Meier Survival Analysis method with 8 explanatory
   variables and a follow-up time of 12 semesters. The application of
   log-rank tests to the estimated curves, for each category of variables,
   found that there are differentiated profiles. The profile with the
   highest dropouts is that of students who enter with more than 20 years,
   males, with a high school average lower than 80, from high schools which
   are not located in Guadalajara metropolitan area, from public high
   schools, without scholarship or credit, with the lowest scores in the
   entrance exam and who were admitted in administration or engineering
   bachelor programs. With these findings, it is possible to identify
   students with the highest probability of dropping out since their

Abstract = {Objective: Analyze the dropout scenario for graduate students at a
   private university in Colombia from 2012 to 2016 to attain sufficient
   data for enhancing strategies focused on keeping students in school.
   Methodology: A quantitative, observational study using survival
   analysis. Frequencies and proportions were calculated for the
   qualitative variables in the descriptive analysis. Quantitative
   variables were measured for overall trends and dispersion. Likelihood of
   student retention was calculated through the Kaplan-Meier method.
   Survival functions were analyzed for each academic level. Likelihood of
   return was calculated through an actuarial method. Results: The dropout
   rate was 5.7\% whereas 72\% of students graduated. Dropout in
   specializations were 4.4\%, Master's programs, 8.5\% and Ph.D. programs,
   19.1\%. The likelihood of student retention in specializations was
   94.1\% by semester 5, 91.7\% for the Master's program by semester 4 and
   80.5\% for the Ph.D. program, by semester 3. The probability of the
   return beyond two years after a student dropped out was 0\%.
   Conclusions: Although CES University strives to maintain the permanence
   of their students, the results of this study will be used to consolidate
   actions towards retaining students and encourage graduation.},

Abstract = {Higher education institutes are increasingly turning their attention to
   web-based learning management systems. The purpose of this study is to
   investigate whether data collected from LMS can be used to predict
   student performance in classrooms that use LMS to supplement
   face-to-face teaching. Data was collected from eight courses spread
   across two semesters at a private university in Lebanon. Event history
   analysis was used to investigate whether the probability of logging in
   was related to the gender and grade of the students. Results indicate
   that students with higher grades login more frequently to the LMS, that
   females login more frequently than males, and that student login
   activity increases as the semester progresses. As a result, this study
   shows that login activity can be used to predict the academic
   performance of students. These findings suggest that educators in
   traditional face-to-face classes can benefit from educational data
   mining techniques that are applied to the data collected by learning
   management systems in order to monitor student performance.},

Abstract = {The Early College Initiative (ECI) high schools in New York City provide
   opportunities to take college-credit courses up to the equivalent of an
   associate's degree while in high school. In this study, we measure the
   association between attending an ECI high school and college
   persistence. Our sample is the 3,271 students who graduated from New
   York City public high schools in the ECI network between Fall 2006 and
   Fall 2013 and enrolled in college. We use survival analysis to measure
   the relationship between demographic, academic, and behavioral risk
   factors and persistence of ECI graduates. We find that Black and Latinx
   students are as likely as White students to persist, when both high
   school achievement and behavioral factors, such as attendance, are taken
   into account. Differences in persistence do exist by gender with young
   women more likely to persist when compared with young men. This study
   provides empirical evidence that attending early college high schools
   has the potential to narrow racial and ethnic gaps in postsecondary
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {Background Regional heterogeneities and sociodemographic characteristics
   affect mortality and population survival in Brazil. However, for
   individuals with Down syndrome (DS) this information remains unknown. In
   this study, we analysed survival and mortality rates among DS
   individuals in the five Brazilian geographic regions. In addition, we
   investigated whether there is an association between mortality and
   sociodemographic factors across administrative regions.
   Methods Data between 1996 and 2016, comprising 10 028 records of deaths
   of individuals with DS, were collected from database records of the
   Department of Informatics of the Unified Health System. Data on
   race/ethnicity, sex, age and years of schooling were defined for the
   association analyses. Survival data were analysed according to the
   Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model.
   Results The number of deaths among people with DS has increased in
   recent years. Children are more susceptible to death, especially in the
   first years of life. Individuals living in the northern region,
   Indigenous women and people with no years of schooling have higher
   mortality. In the Southeast and South region, for White and Yellow,
   survival is related to a higher level of education. Ethnic factors and
   years of schooling influence risk for mortality across the
   administrative regions.
   Conclusions These findings show that sociodemographic characteristics
   affect survival and are associated with the risk of mortality for people
   with DS. In addition, this suggests that differences in access to health
   services among Brazilian regions, especially in the first years of life,
   may affect the survival of individuals with DS.},

Abstract = {The high rate of drop out is still a problem in the distance learning
   system, including at the Universitas Terbuka (UT). At UT, the term
   dropout is better known as the status of non-active students. The study
   aims was to determine the median time and determinant of non-active
   student in distance learning in Indonesia. This study used a cohort
   analysis in student of biology department who first registered in 2012
   to 2014. The median time of non-active students was identified by the
   Kaplan-Meier analysis and the determinant of non-active student was
   analyzed by Cox proportional hazard model. The percentage of non-active
   students in this study reached 42\%, with half of the students becoming
   non-active in the first two semesters. Students who have a greater risk
   of becoming non-active are those who are >45 years old, women, employed,
   recent education is not relevant to the field of biology, knowledge of
   the concept of distance learning and laboratory practice is lacking, has
   never participated in online tutorials and face-to-face tutorials, and
   is not satisfied existing academic services. The optimization of the
   provision and quality of preferred learning services at the beginning of
   the semester will be able to avoid higher-risk of non-active students.},

   We use survival analysis to assess the probability and time to promotion

   race and gender are associated with the probability of promotion to
   school leadership. Holding education, experience, school level, and
   urbanicity constant, Black principals are least likely to be promoted
   and wait longer for promotion when compared to White assistant
   principals. Additionally, findings suggest that even though women have
   over a year more experience on average before being promoted to
   assistant principal, they are less likely to be promoted to high school
   principal, and when they are, it is after a longer assistant

Abstract = {Our paper adds to a growing literature of doctoral training by studying
   factors that drive time-to-completion based on a new and unique data set
   from an international European graduate school. While previous research
   focused on individual factors, we inspect the role of institutional
   factors and the organization of PhD programs for PhD completion. Based
   on a theoretical model, we elaborate hypotheses on three sets of
   institutional factors for thesis submission rates. We use event history
   analysis to analyze register data on 30 entry cohorts of PhD students.
   Our findings demonstrate the relevance of the factors related to the
   institutional environment like the density of supervision and support.
   Furthermore, our results underscore the importance of program
   structuration through clear deadlines and sufficient length of funding.
   We conclude with a discussion on effective measures that can be taken by
   program designers and grant authorities aiming to improve completion
   rates in PhD schools.},

Title = {Computational thinking and assignment resubmission predict persistence

Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {36},
Number = {5},
Pages = {581-594},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Massive open online course (MOOC) studies have shown that precourse
   skills (such as precomputational thinking) and course engagement
   measures (such as making multiple submission attempts with assignments
   when the initial submission is incorrect) predict students' grade
   performance, yet little is known about whether these factors predict
   students' course retention. In applying survival analysis to a sample of
   more than 20,000 participants from one popular computer science MOOC, we
   found that students' precomputational thinking skills and their
   perseverance in assignment submission strongly predict their persistence
   in the MOOC. Moreover, we discovered that precomputational thinking
   skills, programming experience, and gender, which were previously
   considered to be constant predictors of students' retention, have
   effects that attenuate over the course milestones. This finding suggests
   that MOOC educators should take a growth perspective towards students'
   persistence: As students overcome the initial hurdles, their resilience
   grows stronger.},

Journal = {DISTANCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {41},
Number = {1},
Pages = {6-25},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Participants' engagement in massive online open courses (MOOCs) is
   highly irregular and self-directed. It is well known in the field of
   television media that substantial parts of the audience tend to drop out
   at major episodic, or seasonal, closures, which makes creating
   cliff-hangers a crucial strategy to retain viewers (Bakker, 1993;
   Cazani, 2016; Thompson, 2003). Could there be an analogous pattern in
   MOOCs-with an elevated probability of dropout at major chapter
   transitions? Applying disjoint survival analysis on a sample of 12,913
   students in a popular astronomy MOOC that built participants' cultural
   capital (hobbyist pursuits), we found a significant increase in dropout
   rates at chapter closures. Moreover, the latter the chapter closure was
   positioned in the course sequence, the higher the dropout rate became.
   We found this pattern replicated in a sample of 20,134 students in a
   popular computer science MOOC that introduced participants to
   programming.},

Title = {Predictors of long-term mortality after first-ever stroke},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EDUCATION AND HEALTH PROMOTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Data on the factors affecting long-term
   mortality following a stroke in Iran are scarce. The current research
   aimed at investigating the extent of 2-year mortality following a stroke
   and the factors affecting it in the northwest of Iran.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective cohort study was conducted in
   Tabriz, Northwest of Iran. Patients with computed tomography/magnetic
   resonance imaging confirmed the first-ever stroke were included in this
   study and followed up to 2 years. Clinical examinations, including the
   severity of the stroke using the modified National Institutes of Health
   Stroke Scale (mNIHSS), were conducted by a neurologist. The general
   characteristics, lifestyle factors, and laboratory tests were also
   completed. To estimate the survival, Kaplan-Meier analysis was used; and
   for group comparison, the log-rank method was applied. To identify the
   factors predicting 2-year mortality, semiparametric Cox regression
   analysis was used.
   RESULTS: A total of 1036 first-ever stroke patients were included in the
   present study. The mortality rates of stroke in 6-month, 1-year, and
   2-years follow-up periods were 31.6\%, 34.5\%, and 38\%, respectively.
   The two-year mortality rate was 33.6\% in ischemic and 58.7\% in
   hemorrhagic stroke (P < 0.001). In the multivariate Cox model, variables
   age, type of stroke, diabetes, and severity of the stroke, according to
   the mNIHSS index, were identified as factors predicting 2-year mortality
   following the stroke.
   CONCLUSION: The 2-year mortality following acute stroke was relatively
   high compared to that of in developed countries. Implementation of
   secondary prevention is recommended to better management of modifiable
   predictors of mortality.},

Abstract = {Using a data set that captures the introduction and enactment of
   ``campus carry{''} bills between 2004 and 2016, we examined how the
   state policy adoption and diffusion framework explains the policy
   process related to allowing concealed weapons on the campuses of U.S.
   colleges and universities. Panel data logistic regression analyses
   revealed that active shooter incidents, the percentage of Republicans in
   state government, citizen political ideology, and policy diffusion
   influence the introduction of campus carry legislation. In addition,
   survival analysis showed that conservative citizen political ideology
   and anti-gun-control interests are positively related to the enactment
   of campus carry laws. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical
   analysis of the policy process related to campus carry legislation. It
   expands the empirical scope of higher education policy research by
   considering a social problem that, like free speech and transgender
   ``bathroom bills,{''} is only indirectly related to student achievement
   but nevertheless a high priority for some state legislators.
   Importantly, the results underscore the importance of examining how the
   influences of state characteristics and interstate dynamics vary across
   stages of the policy process.},

   drawing on the HEGESCO data set, which provides information on the
   school-to-work transition of higher education graduates leaving
   education in 2002/2003 in four countries: Poland, Hungary, Lithuania and
   Slovenia. The results of Cox and logistic regressions show multiple
   differences among these countries in the speed of labour market entry,
   stability of the first job and education-job match among graduates. It
   is argued that a large amount of the variation among countries in the
   school-to-work transition can be attributed to differences in labour

Abstract = {Can automated adaptive feedback for correcting erroneous programs help
   novice programmers learn to code better? In a large-scale experiment, we
   compare student performance when tutored by human tutors, and when
   receiving automated adaptive feedback. The automated feedback was
   designed using one of two well-known instructional principles: (i)
   presenting the correct solution for the immediate problem, or (ii)
   presenting generated examples or analogies that guide towards the
   correct solution. We report empirical results from a large-scale (N =
   480, 10,000+ person hour) experiment assessing the efficacy of these
   automated compilation-error feedback tools. Using the survival analysis
   on error rates of students measured over seven weeks, we found that
   automated feedback allows students to resolve errors in their code more
   efficiently than students receiving manual feedback. However, we also
   found that this advantage is primarily logistical and not conceptual;
   the performance benefit seen during lab assignments disappeared during
   exams wherein feedback of any kind was withdrawn. We further found that
   the performance advantage of automated feedback over human tutors
   increases with problem complexity, and that feedback via example and
   specific repair have distinct, non-overlapping relative advantages for
   different categories of programming errors. Our results offer a clear
   and granular delimitation of the pedagogical benefits of automated
   feedback in teaching programming to novices.},

Volume = {104},
Abstract = {There are many reasons why students dropout of higher education. Some
   reasons may be unique for students who are enrolled in a cooperative
   study program, because of a second educational player, which is the
   workplace training side, and the above-average study load may be another
   factors influencing the student's decision to leave the program. We
   analyse a sample of 19,769 cooperative students in Germany, including
   852 dropouts. A Cox regression analysis was applied to identify
   indicators for dropout risk. The results show that personality and
   commitment to one's company matter alongside the known determinants of
   cognitive skills. Recommendations for agents (student advisory services,
   companies, etc.) that wish to counteract dropout and motivate students'
   workplace commitment are incorporated in the conclusions.},

Volume = {57},

Abstract = {Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) provide opportunities to learn a
   vast range of subjects. Because MOOCs are open to anyone with computer
   access and rarely have prerequisite requirements, the range of student
   backgrounds can be far more varied than in conventional classroom-based
   courses. Prior studies have shown that misconceptions have a huge impact
   on students' learning performance; however, no study has empirically
   examined the relationship between misconceptions and learning
   persistence. This study of 12,913 MOOC-takers examines how students'
   misconceptions about the upcoming course material affect course
   completion. Using a survival analysis approach, we found that,
   controlling for the score in a pre-course test, students holding more
   misconceptions had a higher dropout rate at the start of the course, an
   effect that diminished over time. Other student variables were found to
   have a positive impact on survival that persisted throughout the entire
   course: U.S. location, higher age, an intention to complete, better
   English skills, prior familiarity with the subject, motivation to earn a
   certificate, and score and time spent on the previous problem set
   (homework). By contrast, student gender, education level, number of
   previous MOOCs completed, and motivation to participate in online
   discussion forums did not affect survival.},

Abstract = {The association between malignancy and thrombosis has been recognized
   for over a century and a half. Patients with cancer have an elevated
   risk of both initial and recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) compared
   with patients without cancer owing to cancer- and patient-specific
   factors. Recurrent VTE is common despite anticoagulation, presenting
   additional management challenges. Patients with cancer also have an
   increased risk of bleeding when on anticoagulants compared with patients
   without cancer. This bleeding risk is heightened by the thrombocytopenia
   common in patients with hematologic malignancies and those treated with
   intensive myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens. Despite the
   advancements in cancer-directed therapy made over the past 15 years,
   numerous large studies have confirmed that bleeding and VTE recurrence
   rates remain high in cancer patients. Balancing the increased and
   competing risks of clotting and bleeding in these patients can be
   difficult, because management of cancer-associated thrombosis requires
   anticoagulation despite known increased risks for bleeding. In the
   context of challenging illustrative cases, this review will describe
   management approaches to clinical scenarios in which data are sparse:
   cancer patients with recurrent VTE despite anticoagulation and cancer
   patients with a new VTE in the setting of severe thrombocytopenia.},

Title = {School administrators' direct and indirect influences on middle school

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION},

Volume = {57},
Number = {6},
Pages = {708-730},

Abstract = {Purpose Administrator support has been identified as a key factor in
   deterring teacher turnover. Yet, the specific ways school principals
   directly or indirectly influence teacher retention remain underexamined.
   The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach This
   study includes a survival analysis to examine when beginning mathematics
   teachers turned over and the extent to which teacher quality and
   administrative support was associated with the turnover, and an analysis
   of exit surveys explaining teachers' decision to turn over. Findings New
   teachers with more supportive administrators are less likely to turn
   over. The influence of administrative support on teacher turnover does
   not appear to be driven by more supportive administrators improving a
   school's professional community, increasing teacher autonomy, or
   increasing the frequency of professional development and mentoring.
   While both increased administrative support and teaching quality
   independently predict reduced turnover, the strength of the association
   of administrative support on turnover does not appear to be related to
   the level of teacher quality nor mediated through teacher quality.
   Originality/value The use of in-depth data on beginning teachers'
   induction supports and teaching quality collected over multiple years
   shows distinct ways administrators influence new teachers' decision to
   remain in their first school.},

Abstract = {Early Career Teacher (ECT) turnover is a critical issue; the teacher
   turnover rate is significantly higher among ECTs as compared with
   experienced teachers, and they are more likely to fill vacancies in
   hard-to-staff schools. This study examines how principal leadership
   might affect ECT turnover by using a large-scale, nationally
   representative data set, the Beginning Teacher Longitudinal Survey
   (BTLS). Using a discrete survival analysis, the author showed that ECT
   turnover in terms of leaving one's school was indeed substantial. More
   importantly, principal leadership had a consistent negative association
   with the odds of ECTs leaving their school during the first five years.
   Among various aspects of principal leadership, principal leadership
   related to student behavior management had the strongest association
   with ECT turnover. In contrast, the association between principal
   leadership and ECTs leaving the profession was not significant. This
   study provides empirical evidence of the importance of principal
   leadership in reducing ECT turnover.},

Abstract = {Objectives: This study assesses students' non-medical use of
   prescription drugs (NMUPD) from college entrance to graduation, and
   examines factors that predict NMUPD. Participants: The study was
   conducted between May 2011 and September 2015 with 338 students.
   Methods: Longitudinal cohort study design was used to examine NMUPD
   across time, and NMUPD-related attitudes and subjective norms. Five
   yearly interviews were conducted to collect data. Cox proportional
   hazards regression analysis was used to examine time to NMUPD. Results:
   Thirty-five percent of study participants reported NMUPD; the majority
   of those initiated non-medical use before their third year in college.
   Analyses indicated that more positive attitudes towards NMUPD (HR =
   1.73, p<0.001), increased subjective norms regarding NMUPD (HR = 1.01,
   p<0.01), and gender (male) (HR= 1.89, p<0.001) were significantly
   associated with sooner NMUPD. Conclusions: Findings suggest that NMUPD
   prevention efforts that target mutable factors such as attitudes and
   subjective norms should be implemented early during students' college
   careers.},

Abstract = {We sought to determine whether pediatric primary care interventions
   targeting positive parenting among low socioeconomic status mothers
   resulted in reduced referrals to the New York City Early Intervention
   Program (NYC-EIP). Participants in Building Blocks (BB) and the Video
   Interaction Project (VIP) were linked with the NYC-EIP administrative
   dataset to determine referrals. In all, 139 of 422 study participants
   (31.4\%) meeting inclusion criteria were referred to the NYC-EIP.
   Although referrals did not differ overall by group (VIP 29.8\%; BB
   33.8\%; control 35.3\%), differences were found for mothers with
   education/literacy of seventh grade or higher (interaction p = .02). In
   that subgroup, VIP was associated with reduced referrals by age 3 years
   (22.4\%; adjusted odds ratio 0.53; 95\% confidence interval {[}0.29,
   0.97]), compared with BB (35.0\%) and controls (34.3\%), with survival
   analysis showing reduced cumulative risk (p = .04). We conclude that VIP
   resulted in reduced referrals for early intervention evaluation among
   children of mothers with seventh-grade education or higher.},

Abstract = {Dropout rates in higher education (HE) are particularly high for
   non-traditional students which may be due to unadjusted educational
   policies. Considering as non-traditional the students who are employed
   at the enrolment moment and using a longitudinal database containing
   information on 5351 students from a Portuguese HE institution, an event
   history analysis approach is employed to distinguish the main drivers of
   graduation and dropout risks for traditional and non-traditional
   students and to test a set of research hypotheses. The results show
   significant differences between the two types of students, confirming
   the need of discretionary policies. For non-traditional students,
   policies that assist them in an early stage are shown to be of critical
   importance, for example by offering pre-enrolment preparatory courses or
   by joining them, in the classroom, with students with similar
   characteristics. For traditional students, providing solutions for
   financial limitations and promoting academic integration seem to be more
   effective.},

Abstract = {Objective: To identify participant characteristics and study methodology
   that influenced the completion of a 15-month community-based
   longitudinal study evaluating the impact of the Supplemental Nutrition
   Assistance Program Education and Expanded Food and Nutrition Education
   Program.
   Design: Observational longitudinal 15-month study across 12 data
   collection timepoints. Sociodemographic characteristics were collected
   with a paper-based survey at baseline.
   Setting: Five counties across central and southern Illinois.
   Participants: Women, aged 18 to 65 years (n = 297), recruited at sites
   likely to serve families eligible for the Supplemental Nutrition
   Assistance Program Education and Expanded Food and Nutrition Education
   Program (housing departments, child care centers, etc).
   Main Outcome Measures: Predictors of participant attrition during the
   study duration.
   Analysis: Cox proportional hazard models.
   Results: Ninety-seven participants were retained across the full study.
   In unadjusted models, greater income and education levels were
   significantly related to lower attrition; however, this relationship did
   not persist in a multivariate model. When adjusted for other
   characteristics, larger household size was the only measured variable
   significantly related to greater odds of attrition (odds ratio = 1.09;
   95\% confidence interval = 1.02, 1.17).
   Conclusions and Implications: Several characteristics predicting
   attrition in other settings were not significant in this study. Future
   attrition analyses that evaluate social support, transportation
   capacity, and type of phone in longitudinal nutrition education studies
   are warranted.},

Abstract = {Eight states currently have bans on affirmative action, yet little

   discrete-time survival analysis on an aggregated data set of 47 states

   characteristics of a state predict its likelihood of adopting a
   statewide affirmative action ban. Results show that scarcity of access
   to state public flagship institutions and policy diffusion are
   associated with ban adoption. Aligning with the racial threat
   literature, the findings suggest that these bans are associated with
   concerns about the scarcity of access to selective higher education
   institutions (operationalized as state public flagships) for White
   students.},

Title = {Beyond positive and negative emotions: Looking into the role of
   achievement emotions in discussion forums of MOOCs},
Journal = {INTERNET AND HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {43},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Millions of students register for Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) to
   look for opportunities for learning and self-development. However, the
   learning process usually involves emotional experience, which may affect
   students' participation in the course, eventually resulting in dropping
   out along the way. In this study, we quantify this effect. Particularly,
   this research goes beyond focusing on only the single dimension of
   positive or negative emotions as many prior studies do. Instead,
   informed by the control-value theory, a more integrated framework of
   achievement emotions is applied in order to gain a comprehensive
   understanding of the role of emotions in MOOC students' learning
   experiences. Specifically, we first built and validated a machine
   learning model to automatically detect the achievement emotions in the
   forum posts. Then survival analysis was used to quantify the influence
   of achievement emotions on student dropout. The results show a different
   influencing mechanism for expressed and exposed achievement emotions on
   student survival in the MOOC course. Implications of the results are
   then discussed in terms of intervention design to improve student
   retention in MOOCs.},

   Loan Repayment},
Journal = {EDUCATION FINANCE AND POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Pages = {627-651},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Students increasingly borrow money to attend postsecondary education.
   Yet, little attention in the literature has been paid to the repayment
   of student loans, aside from failure indicators like default. This study
   examines a nationally representative sample of bachelor's degree
   recipients and the time it takes to reach different repayment thresholds
   on federal student loans. Motivated by a new federal emphasis on student
   loan repayment rates, we use event history analysis to show that
   bachelor's degree recipients have little trouble paying down \$1 of
   their principal balance upon entering repayment. After just six months,
   65 percent of this student borrower population had already done so,
   often paying back much more than \$1. However, borrowers enrolled in
   federal Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans took much longer to pay down
   any loan balance, and many never did in the time we observed their
   repayment. The consistently negative relationship we find between IDR
   and paying down loan balances highlights a tension between repayment
   rate policies and the push for IDR reform of the U.S. repayment system.
   We discuss the policy implications of these findings and offer an
   alternative repayment metric to accommodate the contrasting goals and
   structures of standard repayment schedules versus income-contingent
   repayment policies.},

Abstract = {Despite vast research on transitioning to higher education and student

   differences of first-year students predict their graduation times. The
   present study explored the relation between first-year students' study
   profiles and graduation times in two different disciplines, by following
   the same students' (N = 65) study progress for six years using student
   records data. Profiling students was based on student interviews.
   Statistical analysis of time to degree completion was conducted using
   event history analysis. The results revealed that first-study-year study
   profiles clearly predict graduation times and degree completion.
   Disciplinary differences existed between graduation times, which may be
   explained by the different structures of the disciplines. The results
   imply that individual students need tailored support at different phases
   of their studies.},

   compared the effects of tracks on long-term unemployment from 1995 to
   2015, using a Flemish longitudinal cohort study (4,333 students in 54
   schools). Tracks in Flanders have a hierarchy in mean academic ability.
   Therefore, we compared pairs of hierarchically consecutive tracks by
   propensity score matching students across these tracks. Because many
   students changed track over time, we distinguished between students who
   followed a track completely and those who changed to a lower track.
   Discrete-time event history analysis was used to describe the
   probabilities of becoming unemployed when active (employed or in
   education) and the probabilities of becoming active when unemployed. The
   results showed that students who followed a higher track completely had
   lower probabilities of becoming unemployed.},

Abstract = {Objective: To determine whether completing a pre-enrollment Web-based
   alcohol brief motivational intervention (BMI) increased student
   retention and reduced student alcohol-related violations. Participants:
   Fall 2011 (3,364) and Fall 2012 (3,111) entering cohorts of all
   first-year students at a midwestern state university. Method: Students
   completing the brief intervention (BI) were compared to students not
   completing the BI. Retention was tracked for four years for the 2011
   cohort and three years for the 2012 cohort. Campus and community alcohol
   violations were tracked for two academic years following enrollment.
   Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression were used to test
   retention survival. Logistic regression was used to test campus and
   community violations. Results: Students in both cohorts who completed
   the BI had significantly higher retention and significantly fewer
   alcohol-related violations than noncompleters. Conclusions:
   Population-level Web-based BIs help prevent student dropout and decrease
   alcohol-related violations, with impacts extending multiple years.
   Web-based BI is an efficacious population-level prevention tool.},

   from primary and middle schools in Gansu province in western China, this
   study examines how school and teacher characteristics relate to teacher
   mobility. The school-level analysis shows that school location was the
   most consistent factor associated with teacher turnover. The association
   between higher wages and lower teacher turnover diminished as district
   and wave fixed effects were included. The probability of teacher
   turnover was higher for teachers with higher professional ranks and
   teachers who were initially assigned to schools away from home. We also
   found that failing the annual teacher evaluation increased the
   probability of leaving the school the following year, suggesting that
   teacher transfer might also be used to punish lower-performing teachers.},

Abstract = {Preparing, recruiting, and retaining high-quality teachers into the

   In this study, we analyze data from an apprenticeship-style teacher
   preparation program to understand the relationship between a measure of
   preservice teacher quality-student teachers' observational scores-and
   their decisions to (a) enter into the profession, and (b) stay in the
   profession within the first 2 years after graduation. We find that more
   qualified student teachers are more likely to enter into the profession
   and stay in the profession, even after controlling for student teachers'
   demographic characteristics and their academic achievement.},

Title = {Examining the Recruitment, Placement, and Career Trajectories of
   Secondary Mathematics Teachers Prepared for High-Need Schools},
Journal = {TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {121},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Background: School leaders are challenged by the relatively limited
   supply and high turnover of qualified secondary school mathematics
   teachers. In response, policy makers and teacher educators have
   developed various pathways and incentives to recruit, train, place, and
   support highly qualified mathematics teachers to work in hard-to-staff
   schools.
   Focus of Study: In this study, we investigate the recruitment,
   placement, and early career trajectories of 158 Grades 6-12 mathematics
   teachers from two preparation programs focused on staffing
   ``high-need{''} schools in the same region.
   Setting: The contrasting programs were both supported by the same
   university in the Northeast United States.
   Participants \& Programs: The participants were 158 secondary school
   (Grades 6-12) mathematics teachers. Of these, 48 were recruited and
   prepared through a teacher education program with financial support from
   the National Science Foundation-funded Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship
   Program. The other 110 school mathematics teachers were recruited and
   trained through the Greater Boston office of Teach For America. Both
   programs required two years of service in high-need schools.
   Research Design: In this study, we used a comparative design.
   Descriptive profiles of teachers from each program were created. Then,
   participants' early career trajectories were compared using logistic
   regression and survival analysis.
   Data Collection and Analysis: We administered a longitudinal survey and
   created a database combining survey data and each program's
   administrative data.
   Conclusions: Our data illustrate that the Noyce scholarship-supported
   pathway was generally successful in recruiting individuals with STEM
   majors, training them to be mathematics teachers, and placing those
   individuals as secondary school mathematics teachers in high-need
   schools. The comparison of the scholarship-pathway teachers with the
   secondary school mathematics teachers in the alternative-certification
   pathway provides a useful contrast. On the one hand, the alternatively
   certified secondary school mathematics teachers were less likely than
   the scholarship-pathway teachers to have STEM majors, and the attrition
   rate for the alternatively prepared teachers was higher than the
   attrition rate for the scholarship-supported teachers, particularly
   after they had completed the two-year service requirement. On the other
   hand, the alternative-certification program recruited a more diverse
   pool of potential teachers and placed these teachers in schools serving
   a higher proportion of low-SES students.},

Abstract = {Purpose Competing risk methodology was used to identify variables
   associated with promotion and attrition of newly appointed full-time
   instructors or assistant professors in U.S. MD-granting medical schools.
   Method A national sample of U.S. MD-granting medical school graduates in
   calendar years 1997-2004 who received initial full-time instructor or
   assistant professor appointments from January 1, 2000 through December
   31, 2012, was followed through December 31, 2013. Adjusted proportional
   subdistribution hazard ratios (aSHRs) measured the effects of
   demographic, educational, and institutional variables on promotion and
   attrition.
   Results The final study sample included 27,219 full-time instructors (n
   = 10,470) and assistant professors (n = 16,749). In all models (entire
   sample and stratified by initial rank), faculty who reported all other
   (vs. full-time faculty) career intentions at graduation and were
   underrepresented racial/ethnic minority (vs. white) faculty had lower
   aSHRs for promotion and greater aSHRs for attrition, whereas
   research-intensive (vs. non-research-intensive) medical school
   graduates, faculty at schools without a tenure track, and mentored K
   awardees had greater aSHRs for promotion and lower aSHRs for attrition.
   In all models, faculty with \$100,000 (vs. no) debt at graduation had
   greater aSHRs for attrition. Among instructors, women had lower aSHRs
   for attrition than men, but among assistant professors, women had
   greater aSHRs for attrition.
   Conclusions This study adds new knowledge about career trajectories of
   academic medicine faculty initially appointed as full-time instructors.
   Career development interventions and research mentoring during and after
   medical school and debt reduction programs could help increase academic
   medicine faculty retention and promotion.},

Title = {Examining the Career Pathways of Educators With Superintendent
   Certification},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION QUARTERLY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {55},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-41},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: We used gatekeeping theory to frame our examination of whether
   and when educators with superintendent certification become
   superintendents, and how their likelihood of making that transition is
   influenced by race, sex, and other characteristics. Furthermore, we
   sought to identify variation in career pathways to the superintendency.
   Data and Method: We analyzed 26,071 observations of 4,813 unique
   individuals, representing the entire population of Texas public school
   educators who obtained their first superintendent certificate between
   the 2000-2001 and 2014-2015 school years. We constructed alluvial
   diagrams to visualize these educators' career pathways. In addition to
   compiling a life table and visual displays of hazard, we used a
   discrete-time hazard model to control for individual and contextual
   characteristics associated with transitions into the superintendency.
   Findings: Educators are most likely to enter the superintendency in the
   academic year immediately following that in which they obtained the
   requisite certification. Furthermore, pathways to the superintendency
   differ greatly based on educator sex and race, as well as the level and
   locale employment setting. Finally, we determined that age, experience,
   education, level of employment, and sex all have statistically
   significant impacts on the likelihood of becoming a superintendent.
   Implications for Research and Practice: We discuss the role that
   researchers must play in coordinating with practitioners to ensure more
   equitable opportunity for aspiring superintendents. We also emphasize
   the important role that preparation programs play in preparing
   candidates for the job market. Finally, we ponder further expansions of
   similar presuperintendency research, as well as more robust applications
   of alluvial diagrams.},

   higher levels of relational trust were significantly less likely to
   leave or move, while social network closeness did not significantly
   predict leaving or moving. Further, our findings that special education
   teachers were particularly susceptible to leaving or moving compared to

Series = {Springer Texts in Education},
Year = {2019},
Pages = {79-90},
Abstract = {The main take home message from Part I of this book is that whether we
   deal with simple group comparisons (Chap. 2), measurement issues (Chap.
   3) or missing data (Chap. 4), data-analytic choices ought to be driven
   by the questions that led us to do the experiment, by the features of
   the experimental design that resulted from our questions, and by the
   nature of the data acquired in the experiment (the QDA bridge from Chap.
   1). In this second part of the book, this approach is applied to
   different types of outcome variables. In this first chapter of Part II,
   we focus on dichotomous outcome variables. Examples of dichotomous
   variables are pass/fail decisions in tests, recover/failure to recover
   distinctions in mental health-related contexts, and event
   occurrence/event absence. This chapter discusses different plots and
   statistics for experiments in which a dichotomous outcome variable is
   measured once in time as well as for experiments in which the outcome
   variable is a dichotomous variable in the form of event
   occurrence/absence in a particular time period. Although the latter is
   commonly associated with survival analysis in hospitals, (simulated)
   traffic research for example may focus on the occurrence or absence of
   accidents in different groups of participants studied.},

Abstract = {As states develop and revise Quality Rating and Improvement Systems
   (QRIS), more research attention is needed on the implementation of
   quality improvement strategies that effectively support family child
   care programs. The aims of the current study were to compare family
   child care providers who participated in a model of supplemental quality
   improvement supports (Stars Plus) with family child care providers who
   participated in QRIS but did not receive the supplemental services.
   Specifically, we examined the movement trajectories of family child care
   programs across all five rated levels over a two-year period as well as
   examined whether Stars Plus participation predicted the attainment of
   the highest quality levels in Delaware's QRIS. Results gathered from the
   application of survival analysis to statewide QRIS administrative data
   suggested that Stars Plus family child care providers were 1.8 times
   more likely to move up a star level than family child care providers who
   participated in the QRIS but did not receive Stars Plus. Further,
   logistic regression analysis demonstrated that Stars Plus family child
   care providers were 5.2 times more likely to achieve Star Level 4 or 5
   than family child care providers who participated in the QRIS without
   this intensive support. Findings suggested family child care providers
   may be more successful in state QRIS when quality improved supports are
   tailored to meet their needs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {Educators show great interest in participating in social-media
   communities, such as Twitter, to support their professional development
   and learning. The majority of the research into Twitter based
   professional learning communities has investigated why educators choose
   to use Twitter for professional development and learning and what they
   actually do in these communities. However, few studies have examined why
   certain community members remain committed and others gradually drop
   out. To fill this gap in the research, this study investigated how some
   key features of online discourse influenced the continued participation
   of the members of a Twitter based professional learning community. More
   than 600,000 tweets generated over six years under the hashtag \#edchat
   were gathered. Online discourse was deconstructed to the cognitive
   dimension, the interactive dimension, and the social dimension.
   Text-mining methods were then used to automatically identify these
   dimensions in the tweets. Finally, survival analysis was used to
   quantify the influences of these dimensions on users' commitment time to
   the Twitter community. The implications of the results and findings are
   then discussed.

   2013, we examined the relationship between EAS and the student retention
   rate. The results indicate that when controlling for demographic,
   institution, student performance and workload variables, the EAS is able
   to identify students who have a significantly higher risk of
   discontinuing from their studies. This implies that early intervention
   strategies are effective in addressing student retention, and thus an
   EAS is able to provide actionable information to the student support

Abstract = {Dropping out of high school has adverse consequences, including negative
   effects on employment, lifetime earnings, and physical health. Students
   often fail to complete high school for complex reasons that often

   support intervention and high school dropout. In this study, students
   who attended intervention elementary schools in a large, urban,
   high-poverty district during 2001-2014 (N=894) were compared to students
   who did not attend intervention schools (N=10,200). Likelihood of
   dropping out in grades 9-12 was estimated using propensity
   score-weighted Discrete Event History Analysis. Intervention students
   had approximately half the odds of dropout (p<.001); the probability of
   dropout for intervention was 9.2\%, compared to 16.6\% for
   non-intervention students. Individually tailored student support
   interventions during elementary school can lead to lasting and

Title = {The Effects of Feedback Fatigue and Sex Disparities in Medical Student
   Feedback Assessed Using a Minute Feedback System},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SURGICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {75},
Number = {5},

Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Feedback is critical to the development of medical students.
   To enhance feedback, we created a web application, the Minute Feedback
   System (MFS). This app allows students to request precise, timely,
   written feedback from residents and staff without the burden of vague,
   end-of-rotation surveys. In this study, we investigate variations in
   response rates and feedback fatigue based on sex and rank
   (resident/fellow vs. faculty).
   DESIGN: Data were collected from May 2015-October 2016. The MFS stores
   student requests for feedback along with faculty responses allowing for
   analysis of feedback response rate as well as sex and rank
   identification. Variation in response rate was analyzed using Chi-square
   and log-rank testing. Feedback fatigue was assessed using Cox regression
   modeling.
   SETTING: University Affiliated, Tertiary Care Center.
   PARTICIPANTS: Medical Students, Residents and Faculty.
   RESULTS: About 98.6\% of students (138 women, 140 men) used the MFS on
   their surgery clerkship. They requested feedback from 159 trainees
   (residents or fellows) and 114 surgical faculty. Feedback was requested
   more from faculty (26.3 requests per individual) compared to trainees
   (16.4 requests per individual).
   The overall evaluator response rate was 60\%. Male students were 13\%
   less likely to receive feedback than female students. There was a higher
   prevalence of feedback fatigue among female faculty (11\% less likely to
   respond) and residents (23\% less likely to respond). Regression
   analysis showed that the overall hazard of nonresponse over time was
   1.05, indicative of overall feedback fatigue among all respondents.
   CONCLUSIONS: The MFS is a novel tool for feedback used by nearly all M3
   students during their surgery clerkship at our institution. Evaluation
   of response rates demonstrated feedback fatigue, especially among women
   faculty and residents. Feedback fatigue was more likely to affect male
   students, although the reason for this is unclear. Further analysis is
   necessary to understand this sex-associated response disparity and its
   effect on student feedback in the learning environment. (C) 2018

Abstract = {Against the background of education expansion and economic
   transformations, little is known about how education shapes the
   transition to work in developing countries. Drawing on the cases of
   Vietnam, Cambodia and Nepal, this study examines the association between
   education and the timing and quality of transition to work. In Vietnam
   and Cambodia, school enrolment delays the transition to first paid
   employment, but upon leaving school, higher education attainment is
   associated with faster rate of transition. The education gradient is
   even stronger in probabilities and rates of transition to first stable,
   long-term employment. In Nepal, school enrolment does not preclude
   transition to paid employment, and the relation between education
   attainment and transition to work differs significantly by gender.},

Title = {Does Applied STEM Course Taking Link to STEM Outcomes for High School

Abstract = {Over the most recent two decades, federal policy has urged high schools
   to embed applied science, technology, engineering, and mathematics
   (STEM) courses into the curriculum to reinforce concepts learned in
   traditional math and science classes as well as to motivate students'
   interests and long-term pursuits in STEM areas. While prior research has
   examined whether these courses link to STEM persistence for the general
   student population, no work has examined the role of these courses for
   students with learning disabilities (LDs). This is a critical lapse, as
   these courses have been supported as being one path by which STEM
   material can become more accessible for students with diverse learning
   needs. Hence, this descriptive study examines the landscape of applied
   STEM course taking for students with LDs. The findings suggest students
   with LDs are less likely to take applied STEM courses in high school
   compared to the general population. Additionally, while the general
   population does benefit from taking these courses, there is a unique
   association between applied STEM course taking and advanced math and
   science course taking or math achievement for students with LDs. Hence,
   there is no evidence that applied STEM course taking is related to any
   closure of the STEM achievement gap for students with LDs.},

Abstract = {The dropouts from higher education have become one of the biggest
   challenges for the Brazilian education and represent, among other
   things, a waste of public and private resources in times of government
   budget constraint and struggling economic situation.
   The main objective of this paper is to investigate whether FIES
   (Financing Fund the Higher Education Student) contributes to decrease
   college dropout rates in Brazil.
   Overall, the number of students in post-secondary programs increased
   57.3\% from 2009 to 2016 in Brazil. Along the same period, the
   percentage of people that officially withdrew the courses rose from
   5.0\% to 11.3\% in public universities and, from 8,3\% to 17.9\% in
   private one. If students in temporary interruption (leave of absence)
   are taken into account, the dropout rate rose from 9,4\% to 18,1\% in
   public universities and from 15.3\% to 29.8\% in private ones
   The Tinto's Model is held in high regard in the field of academic
   student retention literature and argues that the decision to drop out
   arises from a combination of student characteristics (pre-entry
   attributes) and the extent of their academic, environmental and social
   integration in an institution. There is also a growing body of
   literature investigating the influence of receiving financial aid on
   retention. Most found a positive correlation between them.
   We analyze the relationship between financial aid program (Financing
   Fund the Higher Education Student - FIES) and dropouts from private
   universities. FIES is a program in which the Brazilian federal
   government provides loans to students at a subsided rate. The program
   was established at the end of the 90's, but stood out only after 2010,
   when the program was relaunched with lower interest rates and more
   extended grace period.
   The study is based on a longitudinal data from Census of Higher
   Education conducted by National Institute for Educational Studies and
   Research `Anisio Teixeira' (INEP) that contains information about
   student situation, loan and other variables about students, faculty and
   institutions and in which is possible to follow a specific cohort in
   time, with available data from 2009 to 2015.
   A Duration Model is used to investigate the contribution of FIES in
   reducing dropouts. The model also shows what factors influence the
   decision of leaving the course.
   The Cox regression results show that students that get FIES have a lower
   risk of withdrawing than those who do not, which is an evidence of the
   importance of government financial aid programs. Variables as gender,
   race, and age are significant and, surprisingly, participation in
   extra-curricular activities increases attrition.},

Journal = {HIGHER EDUCATION RESEARCH \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {37},
Number = {3},
Pages = {484-498},
Abstract = {Studies of psychological distress (PD) in university students have shown
   that they have high prevalence rates. These findings have raised
   concerns that PD may be leading to poorer student outcomes, such as
   elevated dropout rates. The aim of this study was to examine the
   association of PD in undergraduate university students with the
   competing risks of degree dropout or completion. It analysed data from
   the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey.
   The sample comprised 1265 university students. PD (i.e., probable
   depression and/or anxiety) was measured with a validated cut-off score
   of 65 on the 5-item Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5) from the Short Form
   36 (SF-36). The study used an accelerated longitudinal design with
   student year of study as the metric of time and estimated dynamic
   discrete-time, competing risks survival models. Contrary to
   expectations, the study found that students with PD had lower odds of
   degree dropout and higher odds of degree completion than students
   without PD in year 4 of their degrees. This study contributes to the
   empirical literature on university student mental health by showing
   that, while PD can be debilitating and negatively affect students'
   general educational experience, it is not as harmful to academic
   progress as might be assumed.},

Abstract = {Some IRT models can be equivalently modeled in alternative frameworks
   such as logistic regression. Logistic regression can also model
   time-to-event data, which concerns the probability of an event occurring

   regression and the relation between logistic regression and IRT, this
   article outlines how the nonparametric Kaplan-Meier estimator for
   time-to-event data can be applied to IRT data. Established Kaplan-Meier
   computational formulas are shown to aid in better approximating
   ``parametric-type{''} item difficulty compared to methods from existing
   nonparametric methods, particularly for the less-well-defined scenario
   wherein the response function is monotonic but invariant item ordering
   is unreasonable. Limitations and the potential for Kaplan-Meier within
   differential item functioning are also discussed.},

   Secondly, the study gives a detailed analysis of teaching practices by
   analyzing video transcripts. Thirdly, using Cox regression the study
   lends a weak support for the school subject's impact on seatwork and

Abstract = {Higher education institutions in the United States and across the
   Western world face a critical problem of attrition of college students
   and this problem is particularly acute within the Science, Technology,
   Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. Students are especially
   vulnerable in the initial years of their academic programs; more than
   60\% of the dropouts occur in the first two years. Therefore, early
   identification of at-risk students is crucial for a focused intervention
   if institutions are to support students towards completion. In this
   paper we developed and evaluated a survival analysis framework for the
   early identification of students at the risk of dropping out. We
   compared the performance of survival analysis approaches to other
   machine learning approaches including logistic regression, decision
   trees and boosting. The proposed methods show good performance for early
   prediction of at-risk students and are also able to predict when a
   student will dropout with high accuracy. We performed a comparative
   analysis of nine different majors with varying levels of academic rigor,
   challenge and student body. This study enables advisors and university
   administrators to intervene in advance to improve student retention.},

Abstract = {Acquiring simple arithmetic skills at the preschool level requires
   repetitive practices. One method for encouraging students to spend
   longer time practicing is by presenting the skills in an engaging game.
   As student retention on the game increases, the student will be more
   likely to acquire the practiced skill since she will have spent more
   time practicing. In this paper, we examine the relationship between
   internal locus of control and retention in game-based learning
   applications for young children using Todo Math, a mobile-based math
   learning application for children from Pre-K to 2nd grade. We examine
   345,783 users' log data to show that when children prefer ``free{''}
   mode, which has high internal locus of control, their retention on Todo
   Math is higher than children who prefer ``daily{''} mode, which has high
   external locus of control. We present three analyses that support our
   findings using survival analysis, post-hoc analysis, and t-test.},

Abstract = {In this study, we develop and test three measures for conceptualizing
   the potential impact of co-enrollment in different courses on students'
   changing risk for academic difficulty in a focal course. Two of these
   measures, concurrent enrollment in at least one difficult course and
   academic difficulty in the prior week in courses other than the focal
   course, significantly increase students' odds of academic difficulty in
   the focal course in our models. Our results have implications for the
   designs of Early Warning Systems and suggest that academic planners
   consider the relationship between course co-enrollment and students'
   academic success.},

Title = {Risk factors associated with academic difficulty in an Australian
   regionally located medical school},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Month = {DEC 28},
Abstract = {Background: Despite the highly selective admission processes utilised by
   medical schools, a significant cohort of medical students still face
   academic difficulties and are at a higher risk of delayed graduation or
   outright dismissal.
   Methods: This study used survival analysis to identify the non-academic
   and academic risk factors (and their relative risks) associated with
   academic difficulty at a regionally located medical school.
   Retrospective non-academic and academic entry data for all medical
   students who were enrolled at the time of the study (2009-2014) were
   collated and analysed. Non-academic variables included age at
   commencement of studies, gender, Indigenous status, origin, first in
   family to go to University (FIF), non-English speaking background
   (NESB), socio-economic status (SES) and rurality expressed as Australian
   Standard Geographical Classification-Remoteness Area (ASGC-RA). Academic
   variables included tertiary entrance exam score expressed as overall
   position (OP) and interview score. In addition, post-entry mid-and
   end-of-year summative assessment data in the first and second years of
   study were collated.
   Results: The results of the survival analysis indicated that FIF,
   Indigenous and very remote backgrounds, as well as low post-entry Year 1
   (final) and Year 2 (mid-year and final) examination scores were strong
   risk factors associated with academic difficulty. A high proportion of
   the FIF students who experienced academic difficulty eventually failed
   and exited the medical program. Further exploratory research will be
   required to identify the specific needs of this group of students in
   order to develop appropriate and targeted academic support programs for
   them.
   Conclusions: This study has highlighted the need for medical schools to
   be proactive in establishing support interventions/strategies earlier
   rather than later, for students experiencing academic difficulty
   because, the earlier such students can be flagged, the more likely they
   are able to obtain positive academic outcomes.},

Title = {Covet Thy Neighbor or ``Reverse Policy Diffusion{''}? State Adoption of
   Performance Funding 2.0},
Journal = {RESEARCH IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {58},
Number = {7},
Pages = {746-771},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Performance funding has become an increasingly prevalent state policy to
   incentivize student retention and degree completion at public colleges.
   Using a Cox proportional hazards model on state-level data from years
   2000 to 2013, this study analyzes the latest wave of policies that embed
   base appropriations into the state budget to fund student outcomes.
   Results indicate that having a greater proportion of bordering
   performance funding states diminishes the likelihood of policy adoption,
   capturing a ``reverse policy diffusion{''} effect. States with
   Republican-controlled legislatures, more professionalized legislatures,
   and rapid growth in unemployment rates are more likely to adopt the
   policy, while those with higher educational attainment levels and more
   bachelor's degrees awarded per student are less likely. Implications
   include the surprising finding of reverse policy diffusion, which
   suggests that states are delaying adoption until after they can observe
   the political consequences and impacts of the policy in neighboring
   states. Findings point to a policy learning effect-by observing other
   state's experiences, policymakers can make more informed decisions about
   whether to pursue performance funding as an accountability tool.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the precipitants of the diffusion of lifelong
   learning among 88 governmental and nongovernmental international
   organizations from 1990 to 2013 within an event history framework.
   Research on the diffusion of educational ideas among and within
   international organizations usually uses small-n approaches. This work
   looks at the large-scale interorganizational diffusion of lifelong
   learning, an important concept that has until now only been analyzed at
   the national level where worldwide adoption has occurred around the
   millennium. This study identifies astonishingly rapid and wide
   contagious diffusion of lifelong learning originating in core large,
   global, and Northern organizations with a long history before spreading
   to smaller, regional, more peripheral and younger ones. Recently,
   established organizations enter a world rife with legitimized
   educational models ready to be adopted. This article argues that the
   massive interest in lifelong learning needs to be explained by the
   highly institutionalized character of education and the hierarchical
   organization of the field around core and peripheral knowledge
   producers.},

Abstract = {Student attrition in postsecondary education is a significant public

   and when students leave, this investment is lost. To understand the
   factors that influence student attrition in US and Russian public

   empirically as measures representing student enrollment and study
   progress. Using a discrete-time event history analysis of samples of
   eight US and two Russian universities, we provide support for the
   central claims of the academic momentum theory that undergraduate
   students who progress through college more rapidly have a lower
   likelihood of attrition. However, a more detailed analysis reveals
   variability in the relationship between several academic momentum
   measures and student attrition, depending on a university's selectivity
   and the student's chosen academic field and gender.},

Abstract = {Illinois education policymakers have adopted the completion agenda that
   emphasizes increasing postsecondary credential attainment. Meeting
   completion agenda goals necessitates addressing the achievement gap. To
   aid in developing policy to support improved completion, this study
   analyzes a comprehensive statewide dataset of the 2003 Illinois high
   school graduating class attending 4-year institutions using Cox
   regression survival analysis. Study findings indicate that African
   American (0.768 odds ratio) and Hispanic students (0.746) were
   significantly less likely to complete a baccalaureate degree within 7
   years of graduating from high school when compared with their White
   peers. Furthermore, significance held regardless of income level.
   Several factors significantly related to improved likelihood of
   baccalaureate completion were identified including high school composite
   American College Testing (ACT) score, dual credit and advanced placement
   (AP) course taking, type of curriculum, ACT English and mathematics
   scores, and completing the ACT core curriculum. Analysis was conducted

Journal = {RESEARCH IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {58},
Number = {4},
Pages = {395-429},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Public colleges and universities depend heavily on state appropriations
   and legislatures must decide how much to fund higher education. This
   study applies punctuated equilibrium theory to characterize the
   distribution of annual changes in higher education appropriations and
   defines the threshold for a dramatic budget cut. Using data for the 50
   states from years 1980 to 2009, this study investigates the relationship
   between such unique policy events and state characteristics using a Cox
   proportional hazards model. Results show that economic and political
   conditions are most predicative of dramatic budget cuts. High
   unemployment rates increase the probability of cuts while rapid
   increases in tax revenue and wider income inequality are protective
   against cuts. Unified Republican and unified Democratic governments are
   both more likely to cut spending compared to a divided government.
   Sensitivity analyses of state characteristics associated with small
   budget cuts demonstrates that large cuts are indeed unique events
   catalyzed by different conditions.},

Abstract = {Education is one of the strongest predictors of health worldwide. In
   South Africa, school dropout is a crisis where by Grade 12, only 52\% of
   the age appropriate population remain enrolled. Survival analysis was
   used to identify the risk of dropping out of secondary school for male
   and female adolescents and examine the influence of substance use and
   leisure experience predictors while controlling for demographic and
   known predictors using secondary, longitudinal data. Results indicated
   being male, not living with one's mother, smoking cigarettes in the past
   month, and lower levels of leisure-related intrinsic motivation
   significantly predicted dropout. Results support comprehensive

Title = {English Learners' Time to Reclassification: An Analysis},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {31},
Number = {3},
Pages = {330-363},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This study uses 9 years of longitudinal, student-level data from the Los
   Angeles Unified School District to provide updated, empirically-based
   estimates of the time necessary for English learners (ELs) to become
   reclassified as proficient in English, as well as factors associated
   with variation in time to reclassification. To illustrate how different
   aspects of proficiency develop, estimates of the time necessary for ELs
   to attain six separate reclassification criteria are provided. Findings
   corroborate prior cross-sectional research suggesting that the
   development of full proficiency in a second language typically takes 4
   to 7 years. However, after 9 years in the district, approximately
   one-fourth of students had not been reclassified. There appears to be a
   reclassification window during the upper elementary grades, and students
   not reclassified by this point in time become less likely ever to do so.
   Findings illustrate the crucial role that students' initial academic
   language proficiencies, both in English and their primary language, play
   in their likelihood of reclassification. This work has implications for
   the design of next-generation assessment and accountability systems, as
   well as for instructional practices.},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {58},

Pages = {184-213},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Graduation and time to degree are paramount concerns in higher education
   today and have caught the attention of policy makers, educators and
   researchers in recent years. However, our understanding is limited
   regarding the factors related to graduation and time to degree beyond
   students' pre-college characteristics (demographics and academic
   preparation), especially how student decision and performance in college
   affect their graduation. This study employs longitudinal data and
   applies event history analysis to track 12,096 first-time freshmen in a
   large public university from 2002 to 2014. Students' academic progress
   is conceptualized into eight time-dependent variables whose values
   change over time, including major status (major change, double
   majors/minors and major declaration), enrollment intensity (enrolled
   term units and extra enrollment), and academic performance (term GPA,
   cumulative units and cumulative GPA). Discrete-time hazard models were
   used to answer the following question: beyond pre-college
   characteristics, what aspects of students' decisions on majors and
   enrollment and their performance affect graduation and time to degree?
   The findings reveal that academic performance is the most important
   factor, followed by students' decisions on majors (such as having double
   majors/minors). Pre-college characteristics only accounted for a very
   small proportion of the total variance after students' performance and
   decisions are controlled. The study goes further in investigating how
   the effects of these factors change over time by enrolled terms.},

Title = {The Effects of Financial Aid on College Success of Two-Year Beginning
   Nontraditional Students},
Journal = {RESEARCH IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {58},
Number = {1},
Pages = {40-76},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This study aims to understand the role of financial aid in college
   success of two-year beginning nontraditional students. By applying
   discrete time event history models with propensity score covariate
   adjustment to a nationally representative sample from BPS: 04/09, this
   study answers research questions centering around the effects of Pell
   Grants, subsidized student loans and unsubsidized student loans on
   six-year college outcomes of nontraditional students (i.e. degree
   attainment, system departure, and continuous enrollment without a
   degree). The results of this study suggest that these nontraditional
   students were most likely to drop out in the third college year and that
   all three types of financial aid appeared effective for reducing dropout
   risks, but not for encouraging timely degree completion. These findings
   have significant implications for policy and practice including the
   necessity for considering the complexity of nontraditional student
   pathways, backgrounds and unique needs when designing and implementing
   financial aid policy. The findings also contribute to discussions on
   ways to fund nontraditional students and provide recommendations for
   institutions serving large populations of nontraditional students to
   promote persistence to graduation.},

Journal = {PEDAGOGISCHE STUDIEN},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {94},
Number = {3},
Pages = {139-159},
Abstract = {Approximately ninety percent of students move on to vocational education
   after completing prevocational education. In vocational education,
   however, thousands of students drop out each year. Over the past five
   decades several theoretical models to describe drop out were suggested
   (bijv., Tinto, 1975; Finn, 1984; Battin-Pearson et al., 2000). A number
   of 721 students were followed during the first two years in Dutch
   vocational education in order to investigate the effect of factors from
   these theoretical models at the students' drop out risk. Forty-two
   percent of the students (n = 304) discontinued their studies at one
   point during this time. A survival analysis brought to light that
   dropout peaks around or shortly after the transition from the first to
   the second year of vocational education. Higher educational levels in
   parents, pre-vocational education in an economy track (compared to a
   health care track), a lower truancy frequency, and compulsory school
   attendance seems to be associated with reduced risk at dropping out.
   Apart from being obligated by law to go to school, not enough evidence
   was found for the potential role of other time varying factors (e.g.,
   motivation, expectations and the degree to which student have control
   over their own learning trajectory). This finding might be caused by the
   use of operationalizations that deviate from the original ones.},

Journal = {STUDIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {42},
Number = {12},
Pages = {2229-2249},
Abstract = {In the aftermath of the Bologna Process, Germany decided to open
   universities for individuals who do not possess a scholastic university
   entrance qualification but completed vocational education. This paper
   questions how long it takes until these so-called non-traditional
   students enroll and compares their routes to university to the routes of
   traditional students. In this context, the effects of social, cultural,
   and economic capital are pointed out. Event-history analyses for 892
   bachelor students of one German university indicate that these effects
   vary across the groups. On the one hand, social capital accelerates the
   process of entering university solely for traditional students. On the
   other hand, cultural capital prolongs the process only for
   non-traditional students. However, economic capital slows down the
   process for both groups. Multivariate Cox models indicate that the
   availability of capital strongly affects the timing of enrollment of
   traditional and non-traditional students even under control for
   socio-demographic criteria.},

   Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP) in ICU. Aims: This study examined
   the practice of antibiotic de-escalation in neurosurgical patients with
   VAP in ICU and its impact on mortality. Settings and Design:
   Retrospective cross-sectional study conducted in an ICU of a public
   hospital in Malaysia. Methods and Material: The electronic medical
   records of the patients diagnosed with VAP in the ICU were retrieved and
   relevant data was collected for analysis. Statistical analysis used:
   Mann-Whitney U-test and ChiSquare Test were used to compare the
   differences of continuous and categorical data while Logistic Regression
   and Cox Regression were used to estimate the influence of de-escalation
   on mortality. Results: Of the 125 VAP patients identified, only 53
   (42.4\%) were neurosurgical patients. The mean age of these patients was
   40.5 +/- 15.3 years old. The patients mainly had late-onset VAP. The
   most common organisms identified included Pseudomonas aeruginosa
   (19.6\%) and Acinetobacter Multidrug-Resistant Organisms (17.9\%) while
   the most commonly used empirical antibiotic was Cefepime (32\%). The
   proportion of patients with antibiotic de-escalation (10 out of 53) was
   statistically lower than patients without antibiotic de-escalation (43
   out of 53). There was no statistically significant difference in
   ICU-mortality between the de-escalation (2 out of 10) and
   non-deescalation groups (6 out of 43). Similarly, for the 28-day
   mortality and survival analysis, no significant difference was found
   between the two groups. Conclusions: Antibiotic de-escalation practice
   in neurosurgical patients with VAP in ICU was not associated with a
   deleterious effect on survival.},

Title = {How gender and reformed introductory physics impacts student success in

Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {12},

Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {{[}This paper is part of the Focused Collection on Gender in Physics.]
   Active-learning approaches to teaching introductory physics have been
   found to improve student learning and affective gains on short-term
   outcomes {[}S. Freeman et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 111, 8410
   (2014)]; however, whether or not the benefits of active learning impact
   women to the same degree as men has been a point of concern {[}A.
   Madsen, S. B. McKagan, and E. C. Sayre, Phys. Rev. ST Phys. Educ. Res.
   9, 020121 (2013)]. Further, the long-term impacts of active-learning
   experiences are also understudied. At Florida International University,
   a Hispanic-majority institution, we have implemented Modeling
   Instruction (MI) and the Integrated Science Learning Environment (ISLE)
   in introductory physics classes for the past decade. In this empirical
   paper, we report on a longitudinal investigation of student performance
   and persistence in upper level physics courses after having previously
   experienced MI or ISLE in their introductory physics courses, and
   disaggregate students by gender. Using survival analysis methods, we
   find women who declare physics as a major are more likely than men to
   graduate with a physics degree. Women are also just as likely as men to
   pass through the upper division courses, with the highest failure risk
   for both men and women occurring in the first semester of upper-division
   course taking. These results reinforce the need to expand considerations
   of performance outcomes to be longitudinal to measure the effectiveness
   of the entire physics experience.},

Volume = {71},
Number = {4},
Pages = {505-523},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Improving student retention in higher education is perceived as vital to
   the cost-effectiveness of educational systems. Research shows that clear
   educational goals may influence student retention, which suggests that
   helping students make more informed choices may improve student
   retention. In this article, we investigate whether a folk high school
   education prevents students from transfer and whether it makes students
   complete their first undergraduate education faster. The folk high
   school education is a 9-month program at a boarding school that among
   other things aims to help students find out what they wish to do in
   life. Contrary to our expectations, a folk high school education does
   not reduce transfer between institutions or between study programs. Nor
   does a folk high school education make students complete their first
   undergraduate program more efficiently than other students who postpone
   higher education. One policy implication of this article is that an
   academic break in itself does not make students more certain of their
   educational choices, not even at a school that aspire to provide an
   environment that facilitates greater reflection on where one wishes to
   go in life.},

Abstract = {Many nation-states have realized the importance of tertiary education
   and the world has seen a corollary increase in tertiary education
   enrollments. Using Berry and Berry's event history model as a framework,
   this study tests both the internal features of each country and the
   influence that nation-states have on each other with regard to setting
   tertiary enrollment policies. As expanding tertiary education is an
   important policy worldwide, we use Trow's classification to define two
   levels of tertiary education expansion: first, increasing gross tertiary
   enrollment rates above 15\% (from elite to massified), and second, above
   50\% (from massified to universal). Analyzing a unique cross-national
   panel dataset, which spans the time period from 1999 to 2005, our
   findings show that both internal determinants (secondary education
   participation rates and the political landscape) as well as diffusion
   factors (proximity to a pioneering nation and regional variables)
   influence nations in setting tertiary enrollment policies.},

Journal = {RESEARCH IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {57},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-27},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {To address conceptual and methodological shortcomings in the extant
   literature on student mobility, this study employs event history
   modeling to describe and explain how state policy levers, specifically
   state grant aid, relates to mobility and baccalaureate degree
   completion. We find that state grant aid reduces mobility, but less so
   than institutional grant aid. We also find that regardless of the form
   of mobility, it was negatively related to degree completion. This
   inquiry contributes to work on student mobility, (e.g., McCormick,
   Transfer behavior among beginning postsecondary students: 1989-94,
   National Center for Education Statistics, Washington, 1997;
   Goldrick-Rab, Sociol Educ 79(1):61-79, 2006); extends the long line of
   persistence research (e.g., Bean, Res High Educ 12(2):155-187, 1980;
   Pascarella and Terenzini, J High Educ 51(1):60-75, 1980; Tinto, Rev Educ
   Res 45(1):89-125, 1975) by conceptualizing persistence as student flow
   within and between institutions; and offers a conceptual tool for policy
   makers seeking to improve college completion.},

Abstract = {Our previous work has demonstrated that players who perceive a game as
   more challenging are likely to perceive greater learning from that game
   {[}8]. However, this may not be the case for all sources of challenge.
   In this study of a Science learning game called Quantum Spectre, we
   found that students' progress through the first zone of the game seemed
   to encounter a ``roadblock{''} during gameplay, dropping out when they
   cannot (or do not want to) progress further. Previously we had
   identified two primary types of errors in the learning game, Quantum
   Spectre: Science Errors related to the game's core educational content;
   and Puzzle Errors related to rules of the game but not to science
   knowledge. Using this prior analysis, alongside Survival Analysis
   techniques for analyzing time-series data and drop-out rates, we
   explored players' gameplay patterns to help us understand player dropout
   in Quantum Spectre. These results demonstrate that modeling player
   behavior can be useful for both assessing learning and for designing
   complex problem solving content for learning environments.},

Abstract = {This article explores the process of leaving home in the life course of
   young adults in Germany born between 1976 and 1989. Using data from the
   project ``Growing up in Germany{''} (AID:A), the question to what extent
   familial and individual factors influence the timing of leaving the
   parental home and the subsequent chosen life form is addressed. The
   study focused on the role of sociodemographic characteristics, level of
   educational and the framework conditions of growing up in the competing
   pathways of either establishing a single-household or moving in with a
   partner after leaving the parental home. In terms of both transitions,
   the empirical results point to an increasing age over the cohorts
   considered. No differences between East and West Germany were
   identified, while a religious affiliation delays the process of leaving
   home via both routes. In addition to immigration background, the
   respondent's and parent's educational were significant factors. A low
   level of education decreases the risk of establishing a single-household
   and increases the risk of moving in with a partner, while a higher level
   of education promotes the establishment of a single-household and defers
   cohabitation with a partner.},

Journal = {CHEMISTRY EDUCATION RESEARCH AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {365-380},
Abstract = {The ability to use a chemical structure to predict and explain
   phenomenon is essential to a robust understanding of chemistry; however,
   previous research has shown that students find it difficult to make the
   connection between structure and properties. In this study we examine
   how student recognition of the connections between structure and
   properties evolves during the first two years of college chemistry
   courses. In addition, we investigate how an alternative general
   chemistry curriculum (Chemistry, Life, the Universe and Everything
   (CLUE)) impacts students' understanding during these first two-years.
   Using discrete-time survival analysis to analyze student responses to
   the Implicit Information from Lewis Structures Instrument (IILSI), we
   found that it takes multiple semesters for students enrolled in a
   traditional curriculum to recognize that chemical structures can be used
   as models to predict chemical and physical properties. Students in the
   CLUE curriculum, however, tend to make this connection earlier than a
   matched cohort of students from a traditional curriculum, and this
   advantage is maintained throughout the two semesters of organic
   chemistry. In general, the control group takes an additional year of
   organic chemistry to reach the same level as the CLUE students after a
   year of general chemistry.},

   Grade 5, and lack of textbooks, parents' education, and household
   responsibilities in Grade 7 are associated with grade repetition. Also,
   those in larger classes seem at greater risk for repetition than peers

Title = {Answering the Questions of Whether and When Learning Occurs: Using
   Discrete-Time Survival Analysis to Investigate the Ways in Which College

Abstract = {Longitudinal studies can provide significant insights into how students
   develop competence in a topic or subject area over time. However, there
   are many barriers, such as retention of students in the study and the
   complexity of data analysis, that make these studies rare. Here, we
   present how a statistical framework, discrete-time survival analysis,
   can help overcome these barriers to longitudinal assessment studies
   using data from our research on students' understanding of
   structure-property relationships in chemistry. In the study presented,
   we administered the Implicit Information from Lewis Structures
   Instrument (IILSI)-an instrument designed to elicit from students what
   information can be predicted using a Lewis structure-to three cohorts of
   students at five time points over a two-year period, throughout their
   general chemistry and organic chemistry courses, to determine the ways
   in which student ideas about structure-property relationships evolved.
   Using survival analysis, we were able to identify both whether and when
   learning occurred over the two-year period. The single model also
   allowed us to construct trajectories to determine the ways in which
   students developed the ideas that underlie structure-property
   relationships in chemistry. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The effect of surgery resident participation on breast cancer
   recurrence has not been previously reported. The objectives of this
   study were to determine if resident participation was associated with
   either immediate postoperative or long-term breast cancer outcomes.
   DESIGN: We retrospectively reviewed a prospectively collected breast
   center database to identify all patients with breast cancer undergoing
   surgery in a single center during a 9-year period ending 1 January 2010.
   Patients were divided into 2 groups based on whether surgery residents
   completed more than 50\% of the critical portions of the case (Resident
   group) or not. The outcomes of operation length, reoperative rates,
   morbidity, and the long-term outcomes of cancer recurrence were compared
   by group. Comparisons of immediate postoperative outcomes were made with
   chi-square and Fisher exact tests. Comparisons of operation length were
   analyzed by Wilcoxon rank-sum testing. Survival analyses were calculated
   using the Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank comparison. Multivariate
   analysis with Cox regression was also performed.
   SETTING: The study occurred at a community-based hospital that has an
   accredited general surgery training program.
   PARTICIPANTS: In all, 1107 consecutive patients with stage 0-3 breast
   cancer undergoing breast cancer operations were included.
   RESULTS: Median age of patients was 64 years (range: 2497). Median and
   longest follow-up were 5.5 and 12.5 years, respectively. Initial
   operation was breast conserving in 796 (72\%) and mastectomy in 311
   (28\%). Of the 1107 patients, 887 (80.1\%) had resident participation.
   The Resident group was associated with longer operative times. We
   identified no differences in operative morbidity, reoperations, overall
   survival, disease-free survival, or localregional recurrence in the
   Resident and No Resident groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: Resident involvement in breast cancer operations was
   associated with longer operative times but did not affect any other
   perioperative or cancer outcome in our institution. This information can
   be used to reassure program directors, attending surgeons, and patients
   if they have questions or concerns about the safety or effectiveness of
   cancer surgery when there is surgical resident participation. ((C) 2015

Abstract = {Massive open online courses (MOOCs) have been heralded as an education

   analysis to examine the degree to which student characteristics,

   level of commitment, expected number of hours devoted to the MOOC, and
   intention to obtain a certificate, related to retention likelihood.

   fields, highlighting the importance of the JRME to music scholars and
   gradual influence on other fields. Cumulative first-citation proportions
   from music journals reached 50\% in 4 years and 75\% in 8 years. Cox
   proportional-hazards regression revealed multiauthored studies were
   cited more quickly after publication than single-author studies, and
   citation speed changed under different editorships. This study
   reinforces the importance of JRME to the dissemination of research

Volume = {40},
Number = {3},
Pages = {274-306},

Abstract = {In this article, a latent trait model is proposed for the response times
   in psychological tests. The latent trait model is based on the linear
   transformation model and subsumes popular models from survival analysis,
   like the proportional hazards model and the proportional odds model.
   Core of the model is the assumption that an unspecified monotone
   transformation of the response times can be related to latent
   characteristics of the test taker. The model can be interpreted in terms
   of an information accumulation process, according to which test takers
   acquire information until they are able to respond. The rate of
   information accumulation can be related to the transformation function
   of the response times. In order to avoid strong distributional
   assumptions, the rate of information acquisition is approximated in a
   piecewise manner by a positive spline. The model can be calibrated with
   marginal maximum likelihood estimation. This allows a standard test of
   model fit as will be shown. The proposed approach to model estimation
   and model evaluation is investigated in a simulation study. Finally, the
   utility of the model is demonstrated in three real data sets.},

Abstract = {This article aims to describe post-war continuity and change in disaster
   education in Japan. Preparedness for natural disasters has been a
   continuous agenda in Japan for geographical and meteorological reasons,
   and disaster education has been practised in both formal and informal
   settings. Post-war disaster management and education have taken a
   follow-up approach, which means that clusters of measures have been
   developed after critical national-scale disasters have occurred.
   Following this clustering, with a minor amendment, the article discusses
   continuity and change in disaster education, looking at the different
   versions of the national curriculum (the Course of Study) at the
   compulsory school level. It is argued that disaster education has always
   been delivered at school in post-war Japan - this is the continuity -
   however, its treatment in the curriculum has changed over the years,
   from the scientific knowledge model, to the civic participation model,
   to the multi-hazard model, to the everyday life model within broader
   economic, political and social contexts - this is the change. Through
   this historical description, the article sheds light on the complexity
   of the field `disaster education', particularly its two-dimensional
   aspect, namely, `the science of disasters' on the one hand, and `life
   skills for disasters' on the other. Currently, these two dimensions are
   addressed within the policy framework of School Safety. It is argued,
   however, that this complexity has been a challenge in the positioning of
   disaster education in the Japanese system. The article concludes by
   exploring the direction that disaster education has been taking since
   the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami of 2011.},

Abstract = {Today, with states' near-universal adoption of the Common Core State
   Standards, the political system has achieved that which was not possible
   less than 2 decades ago. Just why this is so remains unanswered. Some
   observers have attributed states' embrace of the standards to the
   substantial financial incentives that the federal government embedded in
   its \$4.35 billion Race to the Top initiative. Despite these
   perceptions, little is known about states' adoption and the degree to
   which federal incentivization conditioned their decisions. Using an

Title = {Early school readiness predictors of grade retention from kindergarten
   through eighth grade: A multilevel discrete-time survival analysis
   approach},
Journal = {EARLY CHILDHOOD RESEARCH QUARTERLY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {32},
Pages = {183-192},
Abstract = {The literature on predictors and effects of grade retention is vast.
   Known predictors of grade retention include gender, ethnicity, poverty,
   parental education, and academic skills. The subsequent effects of grade
   retention are hotly debated; however, many studies have shown grade
   retention to be detrimental to the student. The current study used a
   multilevel discrete-time survival analysis to investigate when grade
   retention is most likely in addition to whether school readiness
   predictors influenced grade retention at both the child- and
   school-level above and beyond background and demographic factors using
   data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Kindergarten Cohort.
   The results suggested that grade retention was most likely by third
   grade. Importantly, results indicated that school readiness predictors,
   specifically low early academic skills (i.e. reading, math, and general
   knowledge skills), were the strongest predictors of grade retention.
   When school readiness predictors were controlled for, within schools,
   variables previously shown to be risk factors (e.g. ethnicity and
   language spoken at home) were protective factors, underscoring the
   importance of including school readiness factors when studying grade
   retention and examining school- and child-level effects. (C) 2015

Abstract = {In this article, the determinants of `time to dropout' from doctoral
   studies and `time to PhD completion' are studied using a discrete-time
   competing risks survival analysis for a sample of 3092 doctoral
   candidates from the Universite libre de Bruxelles. Not surprisingly,
   results show that students supported with research fellowships have much
   higher PhD completion hazards than teaching assistants or unfinanced
   students. Concerning dropout, students with no financing showed the
   highest withdrawal rate, while students with selective research
   fellowships showed the lowest one. Dropout is also influenced by the
   ability of the student, which is correlated to their success in the
   fellowship allocation procedure. However, the type of financial support
   influences time to dropout from doctoral studies even when controlling
   for the ability of the student. Finally, our findings suggest that there
   are no significant differences in dropout and degree completion between
   fields of study, except for unfinanced students.},

Abstract = {Recently a number of studies have focused on states' adoptions of
   postsecondary-specific policies. Cutting across much of this research is
   the presence and influence of interstate diffusion of policy adoptions,
   a phenomenon for which support is scant. This paper seeks to address
   this through broadening the categorization of policies beyond the
   discrete form traditionally used to one that encompasses a larger
   conception of ``finance policy.{''} Our sample uses 131 finance
   innovations for 47 states over a 29 year period, finding that upon
   broadening our definition, we can detect the process of diffusion.
   However, the findings are striking, showing that while states do learn
   from one another, the process is dynamic and shifts across time.},

   slower pace in elementary school but have higher overall
   reclassification, English proficiency, and academic threshold passage by
   the end of high school. We discuss the implications of these findings

Volume = {50},

Abstract = {Purpose: Charter schools are unique public schools in part because this
   type of school can close if it fails to meet objectives set forth by the
   chartering body that approved it. Thus far, however, little research has
   been conducted into the causes of charter school closures. In this
   article, we examine charter school accountability. Research Design: We
   consider four types of accountability to guide our event history
   analysis of environmental influences that affect charter school closures
   in North Carolina. In addition, we present two case studies of schools
   that closed in North Carolina to better illustrate the differing
   micro-level processes that can lead to the closure of a school.
   Findings: We find evidence that market, bureaucratic, and financial
   accountability processes influence the likelihood that a school will
   close. The initiation of closure procedures, however, is more complex
   than our quantitative model alone suggests and our two case studies
   illustrate the key role that financial accountability plays in charter
   school closures in North Carolina.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess plastic surgery residents' knowledge, attitudes,
   and comfort with biostatistics.
   DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
   SETTING: Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Johns
   Hopkins Hospital.
   PARTICIPANTS: A total of 22 plastic surgery residents (91\% response
   rate) completed the study.
   RESULTS: The study sample consisted of 18 residents in the integrated
   training path and 4 in the independent training track and was equally
   divided between junior and senior residents. Most respondents ( > 54\%)
   had taken at least 1 course in biostatistics or epidemiology. More than
   90\% of residents reported reading at least 1 plastic surgical journal
   on a regular basis (mean 2.1 +/- 1.5 journals/month). Most residents
   expressed a desire to learn more about biostatistics (68.2\%), reported
   using statistical information in forming clinical opinions (86.3\%), and
   placed a high value on knowledge of biostatistics in appraising the
   surgical literature (90.9\%). However, only 45\% of respondents reported
   being able to understand all the statistical terms encountered in
   journal articles. Only 50\% of respondents felt comfortable with
   assessing whether the appropriate statistical tests were used to answer
   a research question. In case studies, the mean percentage of correct
   responses was 53.0 +/- 24.5\% (range: 0-83.3). Higher performance scores
   were associated with a prior course in biostatistics (p = 0.04) and the
   number of journals read monthly (p = 0.003). Respondents had difficulty
   with study design (45.5\% correct), analysis of variance (45.5\%
   correct), time to event analysis (9.1\% correct), and interpreting a
   95\% confidence interval (45.5\% correct). The number of correct
   responses strongly correlated with respondent confidence in
   biostatistics (r = 0.70, p < 0.001).
   CONCLUSION: Plastic surgery residents place a high degree of importance
   on biostatistics but have only a fair understanding of core statistical
   concepts. ((C) 2014 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

Title = {University hospitals as drivers of career success: an empirical study of
   the duration of promotion and promotion success of hospital physicians},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {14},
Month = {APR 23},
Abstract = {Background: German hospitals have a well-defined career structure for
   clinicians. In this hierarchical career system university hospital are
   stepping stones for career advancement. This longitudinal study
   investigates the impact of working in university hospitals on the career
   success of junior physicians and senior physicians.
   Methods: Consideration of the career trajectories of 324 hospital
   physicians. Discrete-time event history analysis is used to study the
   influence of working in university hospitals on the chance of promotion
   from junior physician to senior physician and senior physician to chief
   physician. A comparison of medians provides information about the impact
   of working in university hospitals on the duration of promotion to
   senior and chief physician positions.
   Results: Working in university hospitals has a negative impact for
   advancement to a senior physician position in terms of promotion
   duration (p = 0.005) and also in terms of promotion success, where a
   short time span of just 1-2 years in university hospitals has a negative
   effect (OR = 0.38, p < 0.01), while working there for a medium or long
   term has no significant effect. However, working in universities has a
   positive effect on the duration of promotion to a chief physician
   position (p = 0.079), and working in university hospitals for 3-4 years
   increases the chance of promotion to a chief physician position (OR =
   4.02, p < 0.05), while working there >= 7 years decreases this chance
   (OR = 0.27, p < 0.05). In addition, physicians have a higher chance of
   promotion to a chief physician position through career mobility when
   they come to the position from a university hospital.
   Conclusion: Working at university hospitals has a career-enhancing
   effect for a senior physician with ambitions to become a chief
   physician. For junior physicians on the trajectory to a senior physician
   position, however, university hospitals are not drivers of career
   success.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study is to evaluate whether a patient navigation
   (PN) program is effective in reducing delay in diagnostic resolution
   among medically underserved patients with colorectal cancer
   (CRC)-related abnormalities in Tampa Bay, Florida. This study involved
   ten primary care clinics randomized either to receive navigation or to
   serve as controls (five clinics per arm). Each clinic identified all
   subjects with CRC-related abnormalities in the year prior to the clinic
   beginning participation in the Moffitt Patient Navigator Research
   Program. Patients with CRC-related abnormalities were navigated from the
   time of a colorectal abnormality to diagnostic resolution. Control
   patients received usual care, and outcome information was obtained from
   medical record abstraction. Using a frailty Cox proportional hazard
   model, we examined the length of time between colorectal abnormality and
   definitive diagnosis. One hundred ninety-three patients were eligible
   for the study because of a CRC-related abnormality (75 navigated and 118
   controls). Analysis of PN effect by two time periods of resolution (0-4
   and > 4 months) showed a lagged effect of PN. The adjusted time-varying
   PN effect on diagnostic resolution compared to the controls was
   marginally significant (adjusted hazard ratio {[}aHR] = 1.15, 95 \%
   confidence interval = 1.02-1.29) after controlling for insurance status.
   The predicted aHR at 4 months was 1.2, but showed no significant effect
   until 12 months. For patients having an abnormal symptom of CRC, PN
   appeared to have a positive effect over time and sped diagnostic
   resolution after 4 months. However, the small sample size limits drawing
   a definitive conclusion regarding the positive PN effect.},

Abstract = {Active-learning approaches to teaching introductory physics have been
   found to improve student performance and learning gains. We report on
   longitudinal investigations of student performance in upper level
   physics courses after having previously taken Modeling Instruction
   introductory physics courses at Florida International University.
   Student performance data were analyzed for academic years 2005-2014 in
   upper level courses including Modern Physics, Mechanics,
   Electromagnetism, and Quantum Mechanics. We compare how male and female
   students who took traditional or reformed Modeling Instruction
   introductory courses perform in these subsequent courses. We look for
   differential effects between men and women who had these two types of
   introductory experiences. The implications of this work for our
   understanding of the impacts of active-learning experiences will be
   discussed.},

Journal = {ADVANCES IN HEALTH SCIENCES EDUCATION},

Volume = {18},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Empirical studies and conceptual frameworks presented in the extant
   literature offer a static imagining of academic failure. Time-to-event
   analysis, which captures the dynamism of individual factors, as when
   they determine the failure to properly tailor timely strategies, impose
   longitudinal studies which are still lacking within the field. The aims
   of this longitudinal study were to investigate the time which elapses
   from a nursing student's admission to a Bachelor of Nursing program to
   their academic failure and to estimate the predictive power of
   individual variables on academic failure. Enrolled students (n = 170) in
   two Italian nursing degree programs during academic year 2008-2009,
   received at the beginning of each years a questionnaire which evaluated
   individual variables. Academic failure rate was 37.2 \%. Time-to-event
   analysis has shown that academic failure occurred after an average of
   664.52 days of course attendance ((CI)-C-95 \% = 623.2-705.8).
   Kaplan-Meier analyses demonstrated a high likelihood of failure among
   males (chi(2) 7.790, p 0.005) and among those who had obtained a final
   average grade in their secondary education a parts per thousand currency
   sign73/100 (chi(2)11.676, p 0.001). Cox regression analysis confirmed an
   increased likelihood of failure over time among males as compared to
   females (HR 1.931, (CI)-C-95 \% = 1.017-3.670), and among students
   living more than a 30 min commute from their place of study (HR 1.898,
   (CI)-C-95 \% = 1.015-3.547). The effect of these two factors on academic
   failure has been seen to manifest primarily toward the end of students'
   second academic year; students at risk might be supported by the
   appropriate university staff prior to this period.},

Abstract = {In this study, we examine the development of student engagement in
   relation to dropout. We focus on different growth trajectories of
   engagement between groups of students and on whether these trajectories
   lead to differences in the survival of the student. The development of
   behavioural and emotional engagement of 4063 graduates and 541 (11.7\%)
   dropouts is examined from Year 7 to Year 12 and this development is
   linked to the probability of dropping out in each grade by means of a
   discrete-time survival mixture model. For emotional engagement, results
   point to a model with two different subgroups: one group starting at a
   high level of engagement and following a (relatively) stable pattern and
   the other group starting at a lower level of engagement and following a
   decreasing trend. For behavioural engagement, the results indicate that
   a three-class model showed the best fit: a high and (relatively) stable
   group, a high and decreasing group and a low and stable group. In terms
   of dropout, the unstable and low groups demonstrate a significantly
   higher probability of dropping out, as evidenced in the steep, declining
   survival curves. Different background variables are included to gain
   more insight into engagement and dropout, and to predict membership in
   the low and decreasing class.},

Title = {Carried or Defeated? Examining the Factors Associated With Passing
   School District Bond Elections in Texas, 1997-2009},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION QUARTERLY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {49},
Number = {5},
Pages = {732-767},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Purpose: Across the United States, a large percentage of school
   districts are in need of facility improvements to provide safe and
   adequate buildings to facilitate student learning. To finance new
   construction, school districts traditionally have put proposals before
   local voters to fund construction through issuing long-term bonds to
   finance near-term construction. However, past literature indicates that
   there are few variables that are associated with bond election outcomes
   that are under the influence of school administrators. The purpose of
   this study was to examine the factors most associated with passing or
   failing a school district capital facility finance bond in the state of
   Texas from 1997 through 2009. Research Methods: We analyzed all proposed
   school bonds in Texas from 1997 to 2009 (n = 2,224) using a logistic
   regression discrete time hazard model to model the probability of
   passing a bond on the first, second, or third attempt, while controlling
   for multiple types of variables such as bond, district, and community
   characteristics, as well as specific election characteristics. Findings:
   We found that the first attempt of a bond is the mostly likely to
   succeed, as well as bonds that propose renovations and debt refinancing,
   or are at the top of the ballot. Also, while percent population over age
   65 was negatively related to bond passage, percent Asian and Hispanic
   students was positively related. Implications for Research and Practice:
   Using past research and our findings, we propose a mediated model of
   school bond passage and provide specific recommendations for
   administrators looking to pass needed facility construction bonds,
   including focusing on passing the bond on the first attempt and
   proposing only a single bond that includes all requests.},

Journal = {RESEARCH IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {54},

Abstract = {In this paper we study the factors that influence both dropout and
   (4-year) degree completion throughout university by applying the set of
   discrete-time methods for competing risks in event history analysis, as
   described in Scott and Kennedy (2005). In the French-speaking Belgian
   community, participation rates are very high given that higher education
   is largely financed through public funds, but at the same time, the
   system performs very poorly in terms of degree completion. In this
   particular context, we explore two main questions. First, to what extent
   is socioeconomic background still a determinant of success for academic
   careers in a system that, by construction, aims to eliminate economic
   barriers to higher education? Second, given the high proportion of
   students who fail their first year and are unable to move to their
   second year, can authorities promote degree completion and decrease
   dropout among students who have already experienced a failure? Using the
   competing risks model, we show that in spite of low entry barriers,
   students coming from lower socioeconomic background are more vulnerable
   to dropout along the whole academic path because of financial
   constraints that prevent them from re-enrolling. Also, our results
   reveal that, after a failed year, a significantly higher proportion of
   students who re-enroll in a different field obtain a degree compared to
   those that re-enroll in the same field, suggesting that universities
   should rethink the mechanisms available to manage failure and guide
   student choices.},

Abstract = {Participant attrition may be a significant threat to the
   generalizability of the results of educational research studies if
   participants who do not persist in a study differ from those who do in
   ways that can affect the experimental outcomes. A multi-center trial of
   the efficacy of different computer-based instructional strategies gave
   us the opportunity to observe institutional and student factors linked
   to attrition from a study and the ways in which they altered the
   participation profile. The data is from a randomized controlled trial
   conducted at seven US medical schools investigating the educational
   impact of different instructional designs for computer-based learning
   modules for surgical clerks. All students undertaking their surgical
   clerkships at the participating schools were invited participate and
   those that consented were asked to complete five study measures during
   their surgery clerkship. Variations in study attrition rates were
   explored by institution and by participants' self-regulation,
   self-efficacy, perception of task value, and mastery goal orientation
   measured on entry to the study. Of the 1,363 invited participants 995
   (73 \%) consented to participate and provided baseline data. There was a
   significant drop in the rate of participation at each of the five study
   milestones with 902 (94 \%) completing at least one of two module
   post-test, 799 (61 \%) both module post-tests, 539 (36 \%) the
   mid-rotation evaluation and 252 (25 \%) the final evaluation. Attrition
   varied between institutions on survival analysis (p < 0.001). Small but
   statistically significant differences in self-regulation (p = 0.01),
   self-efficacy (p = 0.02) and task value (p = 0.04) were observed but not
   in mastery or performance goal orientation measures (p = NS). Study
   attrition was correlated with lower achievement on the National Board of
   Medical Examiners subject exam. The results of education trials should
   be interpreted with the understanding that students who persist may be
   somewhat more self-regulated, self-efficacious and higher achievers than
   their peers who drop out and as such do not represent the class as a
   whole.},

Abstract = {The aim of the study was to explore the time-varying contribution of
   social cognitive determinants of smoking cessation following an
   intervention on cessation. Secondary analyses were performed on data
   from two comparable randomized controlled trials on brief smoking
   cessation interventions for cardiac in- and outpatients. Cox regression
   with time-varying covariates was applied to examine the predictive
   cognitions for smoking cessation over time. Both samples showed
   self-efficacy and intention-to-quit to be strong time-varying indicators
   of smoking cessation during the full 1-year follow-up period, and during
   the post-treatment phase in particular. Less consistently, time-varying
   cons of quitting and social influence were also found to be associated
   with smoking cessation, depending on the sample and type of
   intervention. Self-efficacy and intention-to-quit were the major
   covariates and positively related to smoking cessation over time among
   cardiac patients, in line with social-cognitive theories. Interestingly,
   both cognitive constructs appeared to act with some delay. Apparently,
   smoking cessation is a lengthy process in which the interplay between
   self-efficacy (and intention indirectly) and quitting behavior will
   largely determine long-term maintenance of abstinence. The presented
   time-varying analyses seem a valid and feasible way to underpin
   trajectories of cognitions in datasets with a limited number of time
   intervals.},

Abstract = {This study extends Trow's theory of higher education development to
   examine changes in national-level tertiary education graduation rates.
   Applying Trow's framework we arrive at three stages: (1) elite systems
   with gross tertiary graduation rates less than 15\%, (2) massified
   systems with gross tertiary graduation rates between 15\% and 50\%, and
   (3) universal systems with gross tertiary graduation rates above 50\%.
   This study conducts event history analyses using a unique cross-national
   panel dataset, which spans the time period from 1999-2005. Following the
   work of Berry and Berry, our event history analyses model both the
   internal features of each country and the influence that nation-states
   have on each other with regard to setting tertiary education graduation
   policy. We find significant influences of both internal determinants and
   diffusion factors. We find a positive, significant effect of membership
   in the OECD consistent across both the massified and universal
   thresholds. We also find a positive, significant effect of having a more
   stable political system for crossing the 15\% threshold. In addition,
   being located near a pioneering nation, the UK, has a positive,
   significant effect of crossing the 50\% threshold.},

Abstract = {While a large literature examines the factors that lead teachers to
   leave teaching, few studies have examined what factors affect teachers'
   decisions to reenter the profession. Drawing on research on the role of
   family characteristics in predicting teacher work behavior, we examine
   predictors of reentry. We employ survival analysis of time to reentry
   for exiting teachers using longitudinal data from the 1979 National
   Longitudinal Surveys of Youth. We find that younger, better paid, and
   more experienced teachers are more likely to reenter. We also find that
   women are more likely to return to teaching than men. Child rearing
   plays an important role in this difference. Women are less likely to
   reenter with young children at home. We conclude that reentrants may be
   an important source of teacher labor supply and that policies focused on
   the needs of teachers with young children may be effective ways for
   districts to attract returning teachers.},

Abstract = {Doctoral programs have high dropout rates of 43\% representing the
   highest among all post-baccalaureate programs. Cross sectional studies
   of doctoral students' retention have showed the importance of financial
   aid in predicting degree completion. These studies however, do not
   estimate the labor market's effect on doctoral student retention and
   neglect the longitudinal nature of doctoral study and the multiple
   requirements that make doctoral education a three-stage process. This
   research study examines the effect of various factors, including
   financial aid and labor market conditions, on the likelihood that
   doctoral students will complete the three stages of doctoral education:
   transition, development, and research. The results show that although
   financial aid as a whole is important, the type of financial aid
   received is even more significant and has differential impacts on
   doctoral students' retention at each stage. The study concludes that
   research assistantships have the highest likelihood of degree completion
   compared to students with other forms of financial support. Labor market
   conditions are also an important factor affecting doctoral student
   retention with higher expected earnings motivating doctoral students in
   the later part of their programs to complete their degrees.},

Title = {Measuring Faculty Retention and Success in Academic Medicine},

Abstract = {Purpose To develop and demonstrate the usefulness of quantitative
   methods for assessing retention and academic success of junior faculty
   in academic medicine.
   Method The authors created matched sets of participants and
   nonparticipants in a junior faculty development program based on hire
   date and academic series for newly hired assistant professors at the
   University of California, San Diego (UCSD), School of Medicine between
   1988 and 2005. They used Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards
   survival analyses to characterize the influence of covariates, including
   gender, ethnicity, and program participation, on retention. They also
   developed a new method for quantifying academic success based on several
   measures including (1) leadership and professional activities, (2)
   honors and awards, (3) research grants, (4) teaching and
   mentoring/advising activities, and (5) publications. The authors then
   used these measures to compare matched pairs of participating and
   nonparticipating faculty who were subsequently promoted and remained at
   UCSD.
   Results Compared with matched nonparticipants, the retention of junior
   faculty who participated in the faculty development program was
   significantly higher. Among those who were promoted and remained at
   UCSD, the academic success of faculty development participants was
   consistently greater than that of matched nonparticipants. This
   difference reached statistical significance for leadership and
   professional activities.
   Conclusions Using better quantitative methods for evaluating retention
   and academic success will improve understanding and research in these
   areas. In this study, use of such methods indicated that organized
   junior faculty development programs have positive effects on faculty
   retention and may facilitate success in academic medicine.},

Abstract = {In the past two decades, although access to higher education for
   American students has improved, student persistence in 4-year
   institutions is far from assured. There have been a number of research
   studies on student persistence/dropout in higher education, but most
   have focused on the characteristics and behavior of students as
   illustrated by the ``student-centered research tradition{''}. This study
   focuses on what institutional characteristics contribute to conditions
   that reduce student dropout risks. By analyzing longitudinal and
   hierarchical data, this research proposes and tests a multilevel event
   history model that identifies the major institutional attributes related
   to student dropout risk in a longitudinal process. Evidence indicates
   that institutional expenditure on student services is negatively
   associated with student dropout behavior. Implications of the results
   for institutional practices and future research are discussed.},

Abstract = {Back-and-forth enrollment at different institutions-student swirl-and
   concurrent enrollment at two or more institutions-double-dipping-have
   become common experiences for students in the United States. However,
   empirical studies explaining student mobility are rather rare. This
   study examines how student departures from and returns to a single
   institution are affected by college attendance elsewhere. The model
   presented here demonstrates that departure rates are higher for students
   concurrently attending another college. Return rates, on the other hand,
   are substantially lower for those students who attend other colleges
   after departure from the study institution. The effect of
   multi-institutional attendance differs by college type, with the effect
   of 4-year out-of-state institution attendance being most pronounced. The
   simultaneous analysis of departures and returns provides the study
   institution with a more accurate and complete picture of student
   mobility.},

Title = {Student Flow Between Community Colleges: Investigating Lateral Transfer},
Journal = {RESEARCH IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {53},
Number = {1},
Pages = {94-121},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The traditional unidirectional ({''}linear{''}) postsecondary path from
   high school to a community college to a 4-year institution into the
   workforce represents accurately a decreasing proportion of the pathways
   actually taken by students through higher education. Instead, students
   increasingly exhibit patterns of enrollment that take them through
   multiple postsecondary institutions, both within levels of the higher
   education system (e.g., multiple community colleges, multiple 4-year
   institutions) and across levels (e.g., movement back and forth between
   community colleges and 4-year institutions). These ``swirling{''}
   patterns of enrollment are widely recognized by scholars of higher
   education, but they remain poorly understood. In this study, I employ
   data that address 89,057 first-time students in the California community
   college system to answer a number of key questions concerning lateral
   transfer between community colleges, which, according to prior research,
   constitutes one sizeable component of student ``swirl{''}. Building on
   the very limited work on this topic, I examine whether the reported high
   prevalence of lateral transfer holds true under a more stringent
   operational framework than that employed in prior work. I explore
   whether lateral transfer is primarily an artifact of students enrolling
   simultaneously in multiple community colleges, sometimes called
   ``double-dipping{''}. I investigate the timing of lateral transfer from
   several different perspectives to determine how lateral transfer fits in
   students' progress and development. Finally, I probe the relationship
   between students' level of academic investment in their current
   community college and the risk of lateral transfer.},

Abstract = {Survival analysis is a statistical method widely used in health sciences
   with applications in other fields. Its object of study is the time
   between events, usually called ``survival time{''}. This paper
   investigates the possibility of applying survival analysis to study
   students' retention, dropout and degree in an undergraduate Physics
   course. As a result, it is possible to notice that survival analysis is
   a suitable method, enabling one to describe when dropouts and degrees
   are more likely to occur and what factors are related to retention in
   this course. The goal of this work is to make a brief introduction to
   survival analysis, illustrating its application to the study of students
   flow from a Physics course in a Brazilian university. We believe this
   paper is an actual methodological contribution to researchers interested
   in the topic of dropout and retention in science education since
   survival analysis is an efficient tool for describing and understanding
   student flow.},

Title = {Dropout Rates in Medical Students at One School Before and After the
   Installation of Admission Tests in Austria},
Journal = {ACADEMIC MEDICINE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {86},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1040-1048},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose
   Admission to medical studies in Austria since academic year 2005-2006
   has been regulated by admission tests. At the Medical University of
   Graz, an admission test focusing on secondary-school-level knowledge in
   natural sciences has been used for this purpose. The impact of this
   important change on dropout rates of female versus male students and
   older versus younger students is reported.
   Method
   All 2,860 students admitted to the human medicine diploma program at the
   Medical University of Graz from academic years 2002-2003 to 2008-2009
   were included. Nonparametric and semiparametric survival analysis
   techniques were employed to compare cumulative probability of dropout
   between demographic groups.
   Results
   Cumulative probability of dropout was significantly reduced in students
   selected by active admission procedure versus those admitted openly (P <
   .0001). Relative hazard ratio of selected versus openly admitted
   students was only 0.145 (95\% CI, 0.106-0.198). Among openly admitted
   students, but not for selected ones, the cumulative probabilities for
   dropout were higher for females (P < .0001) and for older students (P <
   .0001). Generally, dropout hazard is highest during the second year of
   study.
   Conclusions
   The introduction of admission testing significantly decreased the
   cumulative probability for dropout. In openly admitted students a
   significantly higher risk for dropout was found in female students and
   in older students, whereas no such effects can be detected after
   admission testing. Future research should focus on the sex dependence,
   with the aim of improving success rates among female applicants on the
   admission tests.},

Abstract = {Few recent issues in higher education have been as contentious as that
   of legislation extending in-state college tuition benefits to
   undocumented students, initiatives now known as in-state resident
   tuition (ISRT) policies. Building on several strands of literature in
   political science and higher education studies, we analyze the effects
   of demographic, economic, political, and policy conditions on the
   likelihood of these initiatives becoming positioned for legislative
   action during the period 1999-2007. In particular, we develop and test a
   theoretical framework distilled from research on ``descriptive and
   substantive representation{''} in U. S. politics. Our event history
   analysis finds that the percentage of female legislators (an indicator
   of descriptive representation), the percentage of the population that is
   foreign born, the level of unemployment, and the type of higher
   education governance in a state are associated with the likelihood of an
   ISRT initiative achieving the legislative agenda. To conclude, we
   explore several conceptual and policy implications of our findings.},

Abstract = {In 1965, appalled by the racial disparity with respect to access to
   higher education, the federal government implemented the Higher
   Education Act. After more than 40 years of programmatic intervention,
   gaps persist. As such, this study analyzes two of the three original HEA
   programs-Upward Bound and Talent Search-focusing on race/ethnicity and
   socioeconomic status, examining program effectiveness on a national
   scale. Based on deformed choices ideology and using a nationally
   representative data set, the National Education Longitudinal Study,
   event history analysis is employed to determine the effect of Upward
   Bound and Talent Search with respect to college attendance rates. Both
   hazard and risk ratios are used to determine the interaction between
   program participation and race/ethnicity. Program participation
   significantly benefits low-SES African American and impoverished
   Hispanic students, providing college attendance opportunities equivalent
   to that of average-SES White students. Once the school effect on the
   hazard function was taken into consideration, the benefit of program
   participation for African American and Hispanic students increased
   further. Future research is required to ensure effective use of
   appropriations, while implementation is extended to the masses of
   low-SES African American and Hispanic students. Directions of future
   research and policy implications are discussed further.},

Title = {Nonparametric Survival Analysis of the Loss Rate of Undergraduate
   Engineering Students},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {100},
Number = {2},
Pages = {349-373},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND
   As presented by Willet and Singer (1991), survival analysis can
   sensitively reveal rich information about when students leave their
   majors. Although survival analysis has been used to investigate student
   and faculty retention, it has not been applied to undergraduate
   engineering student retention.
   PURPOSE (HYPOTHESIS)
   The impact of cohort, gender, ethnicity, and SAT math and verbal scores
   on the loss rate of undergraduate engineering students was investigated
   to answer the questions: Does the profile of risk of dropout differ
   among groups with different backgrounds? When are students most likely
   to leave engineering? Which SAT scores better predict the risk of
   dropout?
   DESIGN/METHOD
   Using a large longitudinal database that includes 100,179 engineering
   students from nine universities and spans 19 years, nonparametric
   survival analysis was adopted to obtain nonparametric estimates of
   survival and associated hazard functions, and complete rank tests for
   the association of variables.
   RESULTS
   There are significant differences for early semesters: White or female
   students tend to leave engineering earlier than other populations.
   Engineering students leave engineering during the third semester the
   most, although students who have an SAT math score less than 550 tend to
   leave engineering during the second semester. SAT math score better
   predicts the risk of dropout than SAT verbal score.
   CONCLUSIONS
   The results of this study support using survival analysis to better
   understand factors that determine student success since student
   retention is a dynamic problem. Survival analysis allows characteristics
   such as risk to be evaluated by semester, giving insight to when
   interventions might be most effective.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to identify the main determinants of
   time-to-degree in higher education. Our results use retrospective data
   on the full cohort of first-time entering students who embarked on short
   and long programs from one university in Spain and who were observed
   over an 8-year period ending in 2004. The descriptive analyses show that
   less than 40\% of degree recipients are able to graduate within the
   minimum period of time. Duration models are estimated for different
   types of programs. The empirical results show that time-to-completion is
   extremely sensitive to students' abilities and, to a much lesser extent,
   to socio-economic background, motivation when entering the program and,
   gender. We find no evidence that delayed enrollment or size of program
   is associated with the amount of time it takes to earn a degree. Other
   things held constant, graduates who receive financial support
   continuously through the entire period finish faster, and promoting
   student performance at the beginning of the program significantly speeds
   student progress toward a degree.},

Abstract = {In this paper I evaluate the effect of student aid on the success of
   academic studies. I focus on two dimensions, the duration of study and
   the probability of actually graduating with a degree. To determine the
   impact of financial student aid, I estimate a discrete-time duration
   model allowing for competing risks to account for different exit states
   (graduation and dropout) using individual level panel data from the
   German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) for the years 1984-2007. My findings
   suggest that the duration of study is responsive to the type of
   financial support a student receives. There are three main results.
   First, student aid recipients finish faster than comparable students who
   are supported by the same amount of parental/private transfers only.
   Second, although higher financial aid does on average not affect the
   duration of study, this effect is (third) dominated by the increased
   probability of actually finishing university successfully. (c) 2010

Abstract = {One of the main intentions of the comprehensive higher education reform
   in Norway in 2003 was to improve student performance and completion. One
   way of doing this is to reduce the number of students leaving an
   institution. Institutions have limited options for reducing student
   departure, and one of the few routes open to them is changing the
   structure of study programmes. This article investigates the Norwegian
   higher education reform to examine whether it has had an effect on
   dropout and transfer rates from university undergraduate education by
   using survival analysis. Results indicate that rates of departure from
   university are lower after the reform compared to before. However, the
   only significant change has been in the transfer rate, with no
   significant change in the dropout rate. The rate of student departure is
   still relatively high, and will therefore continue to have economic
   consequences for higher education institutions.},

Abstract = {The past two decades have been a period of far-reaching policy

   find that more liberal governments were more likely to adopt prepaid
   tuition plans, that states with more competitive elections were less

   with decentralized governance were more likely to adopt one of these

Title = {Predicting STEM Degree Outcomes Based on Eighth Grade Data and Standard
   Test Scores},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {99},
Number = {3},
Pages = {209-223},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND
   Early identification of students who are potential candidates for
   achieving a degree in a Science, Technology, Engineering, or Mathematics
   (STEM) major would enable educators to offer programs designed to better
   enhance student interests and capabilities in those areas.
   PURPOSE (HYPOTHESIS)
   This study uses an integrated model leveraging the strengths of multiple
   statistical techniques to analyze the educational process from pre-high
   school through college and predict which students will achieve a STEM
   education.
   DESIGN/METHOD
   The probability of earning a STEM degree is modeled using variables
   available as of the eighth grade as well as standardized test scores
   from high school. These include demographic, attitudinal, experiential,
   and academic performance measures derived from the National Education
   Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) dataset. The integrated model
   combines logistic regression, survival analysis, and receiver operating
   characteristics (ROC) curve analysis to predict whether an individual is
   likely to obtain a STEM degree.
   RESULTS
   Predicted results of the integrated model were compared to actual
   outcomes and those of a separate logistic regression model. The modeling
   process identified a set of significant predictive variables and
   achieved very good predictive accuracy. The integrated model and
   logistic regression model performed with comparable precision.
   CONCLUSIONS
   The modeling process was adept at identifying STEM students and a large
   pool of other degree students that might have been capable of pursuing a
   STEM degree. The results suggest that it is quite feasible to identify
   good STEM candidates for a pro-STEM intervention to engage their
   interest in STEM and support stronger quantitative skill development.},

Title = {Progress of medical students after open admission or admission based on

Journal = {MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2010},

Abstract = {CONTEXT Although admission to university in Austria is generally open
   for applicants who have successfully completed secondary school, in some
   areas of study, including human medicine and dentistry, the selection of
   students by additional criteria has become legally possible as a result
   of a decision by the European Court in 2005. We studied the impact of
   this important change on the temporal pattern of medical students'
   progress through the study programme.
   METHODS All 2532 regular students admitted to the diploma programme in
   human medicine at the Medical University of Graz during the academic
   years 2002/03-2007/08 were included in the analysis. Non-parametric and
   semi-parametric survival analysis techniques were employed to compare
   the time required to complete the first two study semesters (first part
   of the curriculum) before and after the implementation of admission
   tests. Temporal patterns of dropout before this goal was achieved were
   also investigated. Sex, age and nationality of students were assessed as
   potential confounding variables.
   RESULTS The cumulative probability of study success was dramatically
   better in selected students versus those who were admitted openly (P <
   0.0001). Whereas only 20.1-26.4\% of openly admitted students completed
   the first two study semesters within the scheduled time of 1 year, this
   percentage rose to 75.6-91.9\% for those selected by admission tests.
   Similarly, the cumulative probability for dropping out of study was also
   significantly lower in selected students (P < 0.0001). By univariate as
   well as multivariate techniques, student nationality, age and sex were
   also identified as partly significant, albeit weak, predictors.
   DISCUSSIONS The analysis convincingly demonstrates that, by contrast
   with open admission, performance-based selection of medical students
   significantly raises the probability of successful study progress.
   Additionally, the proportion of dropouts is significantly reduced. Thus,
   admission tests save considerable costs, in terms of both student time
   and public resources.},

Abstract = {Studies of student risk of school dropout have shown that present
   predictors of at-risk status do not accurately identify a large
   percentage of students who eventually drop out. Through the analysis of
   the entire Grade 1-12 longitudinal cohort-based grading histories of the
   class of 2006 for two school districts in the United States, the author
   extends past longitudinal conceptions of dropout to a longitudinal risk
   perspective, using survival analysis, life tables, and discrete-time
   hazard modeling to appropriately account for student graduation,
   transfer, or dropout. The risk of dropout began in Grade 7, with the
   most hazardous years at Grades 8 and 11. A novel calculation of
   teacher-assigned grades, noncumulative GPA, is identified as a strong
   predictor of student dropout.},

Abstract = {From individual longitudinal data for a full cohort of first-entering

   dropout and completion rates averaging 50 and 36\%, respectively.
   However, we find considerable variability in the probabilities of
   withdrawal, transfer, and graduation among students. In this regard, our
   results show that preenrollment academic ability, age at enrollment,

Abstract = {Variables that address student enrollment patterns (e.g., persistence,
   enrollment inconsistency, completed credit hours, course credit load,
   course completion rate, procrastination) constitute a longstanding
   fixture of analytical strategies in educational research, particularly
   research that focuses on explaining variation in academic outcomes.
   However, nearly all measures of enrollment patterns are handicapped by
   untested assumptions about a more fundamental measure, namely students'
   rate of progress. In this paper, I first explain how a variety of widely
   used measures of enrollment patterns are inextricably linked to
   students' rate of progress. I then describe a method of modeling
   mathematically students' rate of progress that employs hierarchical
   (multilevel) discrete-time event history analysis of repeated events. I
   conclude with an empirical example of the application of this method in
   which I test several hypotheses concerning students' rate of progress
   through the remedial math sequence toward the outcome of college-level
   math competency. In addition to the utility of the method that is
   proposed here, the issues discussed in this paper have important
   practical implications for institutional research, particularly with
   respect to the use of the various measures of enrollment patterns to
   explain variation in students' attainment.},

   Reality, Simulators: A Comparison of Proctored and Independent
   Approaches},

Volume = {66},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) simulators for laparoscopy and
   endoscopy may be valuable tools for resident education. However, the
   cost of such training in terms of trainee and instructor time may vary
   depending upon whether an independent or proctored approach is employed.
   METHODS: We performed a randomized controlled trial to compare
   independent and proctored methods of proficiency-based VR simulator
   training. Medical students were randomized to independent or proctored
   training groups. Groups were compared with respect to the number of
   training hours and task repetitions required to achieve expert level
   proficiency on laparoscopic and endoscopic simulators. Cox regression
   modeling was used to compare time to proficiency between groups, with
   adjustment for appropriate covariates.
   RESULTS: Thirty-six medical students (18 independent, 18 proctored) were
   enrolled. Achievement of overall simulator proficiency required a median
   of 11 hours of training (range, 6-21 hours). Laparoscopic and endoscopic
   proficiency were achieved after a median of 11 (range, 6-32) and 10
   (range, 5-27) task repetitions, respectively. The number of repetitions
   required to achieve proficiency was similar between groups. After
   adjustment for covariates, trainees in the independent group achieved
   simulator proficiency with significantly fewer hours of training (hazard
   ratio, 2.62; 95\% confidence interval, 1.01-6.85; P = 0.048).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study quantifies the cost, in instructor and trainee
   hours, of proficiency-based laparoscopic and endoscopic VR simulator
   training, and suggests that proctored instruction does not offer any
   advantages to trainees. The independent approach may be preferable for
   surgical residency programs desiring to implement VR simulator training.

Abstract = {This study analyzes the policy process through which two states
   determined education beneficiary programs of newly adopted state
   lotteries. Tennessee, in 2003, followed the regional pattern of
   allocating all lottery proceeds to merit-based college scholarships.
   North Carolina, in 2005, bucked this trend by allotting no lottery
   revenue for merit aid. This comparative case study draws on extensive
   interview and archival data to test the explanatory power of a revised
   multiple streams model. Our findings indicate that both stable
   characteristics, such as government structure and intra-state policy
   trends, and anarchical influences, such as the timing and strategies of
   policy entrepreneurs, matter most.},

   what characteristics of states are associated with the adoption of these
   policies? Second, to what extent do conventional theories on policy
   adoption help explain the rise of dual enrollment? We find state
   political characteristics, organizational structures, and policy
   conditions are associated with the spread of dual enrollment policies.
   Also, some states appear to have a climate for reform activity,
   resulting in a tendency to engage in innovative education policy making.},

Abstract = {Purpose
   To measure overall retention of junior faculty and evaluate the effects
   of a junior faculty development program on the retention of junior
   faculty at one institution.
   Method
   Quantitative survival analysis techniques were used to characterize
   retention of all new assistant professors hired at the University of
   California, San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine for 18 years between
   July 1988 and December 2005, and the influence on retention of a junior
   faculty development program established in 1998. Data available included
   initial hire date, gender, ethnicity, participation in the faculty
   development program, and date of separation from UCSD. Actuarial
   Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox proportional hazard analyses were used to
   characterize retention and the influence of covariates up to the end of
   the probationary period, eight years after initial hire date.
   Results
   For the 839 new assistant professors, participation in the faculty
   development program and being hired after July 1997 had significant
   effects on retention. After adjusting for hire date, gender, and
   ethnicity, faculty participating in the faculty development program were
   67\% more likely to remain at UCSD at the end of their probationary
   period compared with nonparticipating faculty.
   Conclusions
   Faculty development programs for junior faculty in academic medicine can
   have positive effects on faculty retention and may facilitate success in
   academic medicine. Acad Med. 2009: 84:37-41.},

Abstract = {The goal of this study was to illustrate survival analysis with higher
   education data and gain insight into a limited set of factors that

   four departments. Data were collected on when students pass their
   first-year examination, prior achievement and procrastination. The
   analysis showed that 69\% of the students had not passed their
   examination within the nominal study length of 12 months. The estimated
   median lifetime, the time when 50\% of the students had passed their
   examination, was after 23 months. Students from the 2nd department
   passed their examination fastest. Female students reached the estimated
   median lifetime at 20 months, younger students at 16 months, older
   students at 24+ months and students with high prior achievement scores
   at 12 months. The analysis finally indicated that age, prior achievement
   and procrastination predicted passing first-year examinations.},

Abstract = {Children already differ in their educational prospects when they start
   school. Attending a child care center is often seen as an adequate means
   for compensation because such formal child care settings can yield
   positive effects on different skills. However, the starting time and
   therefore the duration of preschool attendance are probably selective.
   This selectivity in the timing of preschool attendance is analyzed in
   this article by means of survival analysis. The empirical analyses are
   conducted with data of the project `Preschool Education and Educational
   Careers among Migrant Children' in which German and Turkish parents of
   3-4-year-old children were surveyed. On average, the German children
   start preschool earlier than the children with a Turkish migration
   background. Knowledge about the institution `Kindergarten' proves to be
   an important determinant. The existence of role models in the social
   network has a significant effect only in the Turkish sample. In Turkish
   families, children start preschool earlier if their parents have a good
   knowledge of German.},

Abstract = {This event history analysis explores factors driving the emergence over
   recent decades of comprehensive state-level student unit-record {[}SUR]
   systems, a potentially powerful tool for increasing student success.
   Findings suggest that the adoption of these systems is rooted in demand
   and ideological factors. Larger states, states with high proportions of
   students of traditional college-going age, and states subject to federal
   civil-rights monitoring, were more likely to adopt SUR systems,
   suggesting influences of demands posed by size and legal constraints. In
   addition, states with more liberal citizen ideology were more likely to
   adopt the systems. Interestingly, the strength of private colleges and
   universities in a state worked against the adoption of SUR systems,
   suggesting that privacy and autonomy concerns were important deterrents
   to adoption. The results of this analysis illuminate the factors that
   inhibit and enhance SUR systems' organizational and philosophical
   acceptance, and thus ideally can contribute to future policymaking in
   this arena.},

Abstract = {Burton Clark's proposition concerning the cooling out of underprepared
   students in community colleges has a controversial history and remains a
   point of contention. Central to Clark's description of the cooling out
   process is the academic counselor, whose job it is to dissuade
   underprepared students from goals perceived to be overambitious and ease
   these students into lesser, presumably better-fitting academic
   trajectories. In this study, I test a number of hypotheses concerning
   the effect of advising on students' chances of attaining their goals. I
   seek to determine what effect advising has on students' attainment, and
   whether this effect is dependent upon students' academic preparation,
   students' race/ethnicity, the racial/ethnic composition of the college,
   or the representation of underprepared students in the college. I use
   hierarchical discrete-time event history analysis to analyze data that
   address two subsets of the Fall 1995 cohort of first-time freshmen who
   enrolled in any of California's 107 semester-based community colleges. I
   find that advising is actively beneficial to students' chances of
   success, and all the more so for students who face academic
   deficiencies, which contradicts deductions drawn from Clark's
   description of the active role of counselors in the cooling out process.},

Abstract = {This article uses data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth
   1997 to investigate high school dropout and its association with the
   high school curriculum. In particular, it examines how combinations of
   career and technical education (CTE) and core academic courses influence
   the likelihood of leaving school. Hazards models indicate a significant
   curvilinear association between the CTE-to-academic course-taking ratio
   and the risk of dropping out for youths who were aged 14 and younger
   when they entered the ninth grade (not old for grade). This finding
   suggests that a middle-range mix of exposure to CTE and an academic
   curriculum can strengthen a student's attachment to or motivation while
   in school. The same association was not found between course taking and
   the likelihood of dropping out for youths who were aged 15 or older when
   they entered high school, thus prompting further consideration of the
   situation of being old for grade in school settings that remain highly
   age graded in their organization.},

Abstract = {This article examines the determinants of children's schooling during
   the 1990s in rural areas of Vietnam. It focuses on the impact of family
   attributes on the likelihood of children remaining in school or leaving
   during the primary and secondary school years. Using data from the
   Vietnam Living Standard Survey (VLSS) of 1992-93 and 199798, the authors
   apply the survival analysis technique to follow a group of 3301 children
   aged between 6 and 13 over a 5-year period. In addition to the
   characteristics of the children and their families, they consider
   community attributes as larger contextual variables that also affect
   children's school leaving. Overall, they found very significant
   socioeconomic differentiations between families with respect to
   schooling, which puts economically disadvantaged children at risk for
   having their schooling interrupted at a young age. The results also
   indicate that for girls, compared with boys, the likelihood of staying
   in school is more responsive to household and community characteristics.},

   examine the interaction between financial aid type and parental income
   to explore whether, and if so how, different types of aid may reduce the
   dropout gap by income level group. We find that the receipt of a Pell
   grant is related to narrowing the dropout gap between students from low-
   and middle-income groups, although overall the interaction between Pell
   grant and income is not significant. Loans and work-study aid both have
   similar effects on student dropout across all income groups.
   Methodologically, our results demonstrate the need to model dropout
   behavior temporally and to avoid main-effect bias by incorporating
   interaction effects.},

Title = {Predicting ecstasy use among young people at risk: A prospective study

Journal = {JOURNAL OF DRUG EDUCATION},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {38},

Pages = {131-146},
Abstract = {Our aim is to identify predictors of first-time ecstasy use in a
   prospective study among young people at risk. As part of the
   multidisciplinary Netherlands XTC Toxicity Study (NeXT), we monitored
   188 Subjects aged >= 18 who were ecstasy-naive at baseline but seemed
   likely to start taking ecstasy in the near future. After an 11- to
   26-month follow-up period, 160 respondents remained (85.1\%; mean age
   21.0 years, 58.1\% females): 65 who took ecstasy at least once (ecstasy
   users) and 95 non-users. At baseline and four times during follow-up,
   respondents completed self-report questionnaires. Cox regression
   analysis was used to examine the effects of baseline respondent
   characteristics on incident ecstasy use. Development of peer group
   ecstasy use was analyzed by logistic regression. Intention to use
   ecstasy, low education, and current weekly cannabis use independently
   increased the hazard rate for first ecstasy use. Although ecstasy use
   among peers at baseline was not a predictor, the proportion of ecstasy
   users with ecstasy-using peers increased markedly during the study. Our
   results suggest that targeted prevention activities should focus in
   particular on young people who have strong intentions to take ecstasy,
   especially if they are also regular smokers of cannabis.},

Title = {Careers in Motion: A Longitudinal Retention Study of Role Changing Among
   Early-Career Urban Educators},
Journal = {TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {110},
Number = {1},
Pages = {218-250},
Abstract = {Background/Context: Teacher retention, especially of qualified teachers
   within high-poverty schools, is an issue of local, national, and
   international concern. School staffing research has typically examined
   two groups: those who remain in full-time classroom teaching versus
   those who quit teaching altogether. This article complicates the teacher
   staffing picture and adds a third category of attrition: role changing,
   which is the phenomenon of teachers shifting into nonteaching
   professional roles in the field of education.
   Purpose: We asked what proportion of teacher career movement within our
   sample was attributable to leaving teaching versus role changing.
   Further, we wanted to know the influence of race/ethnicity, gender,
   credential type, and age on role-changing patterns.
   Research Design: To deepen our understanding of teacher career patterns,
   we conducted a 6-year longitudinal study that involved collecting survey
   data on teacher career movement, school experiences, and attitudes from
   838 well-prepared urban educators in their first through eighth career
   year. These educators had all completed master's degrees in the teacher
   education program of a high-status urban public university and all began
   their careers as teachers. After collecting the data, we documented and
   diagrammed career patterns. In addition, we analyzed the influence of
   select time invariant covariates on the hazard probabilities of both
   role changing and leaving education.
   Findings/Results: The study found that not only did teachers move into a
   variety of non-teaching roles within the field of education, but they
   also followed diverse career ``pathways{''} along the way. Survival
   analysis substantiated prior research showing that Latino teachers have
   lower attrition rates from the field of education compared with White
   teachers, but this effect disappeared for role changing with the field.
   In terms of gender, the men in our population were less likely to leave
   education entirely than women but more likely to leave teaching for a
   role change in career years 3-8. Teachers with single-subject
   (secondary) credentials were more likely than their colleagues who held
   multiple-subject (elementary) credentials to leave teaching for a role
   change in education.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: Set within the framework of teacher
   professionalism, we argue that role changing is a form of sanctioned
   attrition and that understanding movement among roles within the
   educational workforce is essential for crafting policies and incentives
   to keep well-prepared teachers rooted in careers that serve the nation's
   most under-served students.},

Title = {Do developmental mathematics programs have a causal impact on student
   retention? An application of discrete-time survival and
   regression-discontinuity analysis},
Journal = {RESEARCH IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {48},
Number = {5},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The impact of academic programs-such as developmental mathematics
   programs-on student retention, has been a controversial topic for
   administrators, policy makers, and faculty in higher education. Despite
   deep interest in the effectiveness of these programs in retaining
   students, scholars have been unable to determine whether such programs
   have a causal impact on student retention. Rather than assigning
   students to a developmental program based on a random assignment process
   as in a true experiment, most of the existing research up to this point
   has been non-experimental and has focused exclusively on whether student
   background and demographic characteristics are statistically significant
   predictors of dropout. Furthermore, prior research is also limited by
   its reliance on cross-sectional, retrospective designs despite the
   longitudinal nature of the dropout phenomenon. In this paper, I report
   the results of a unique piece of research which embeds a
   regression-discontinuity design within the framework provided by
   discrete-time survival analysis. By combining these two approaches, I
   was able to obtain an unbiased estimate of the causal impact of
   participating in a developmental program in mathematics, and confirm
   that the risk of leaving college among students who participate in
   developmental mathematics programs was significantly lower than for
   equivalent students who did not participate in such programs.},

Abstract = {This study utilizes discrete-time survival analysis to assess the effect
   of level of academic achievement (both contemporaneously and
   prospectively) and changes in academic achievement on initiation of
   marijuana use among rural adolescents in junior high school. In the
   sample under consideration, 36\% of boys and 23\% of girls initiated use
   of marijuana by the end of ninth grade. Consistent with our hypothesis,
   poor academic achievement is a salient predictor of initiation of
   marijuana use among both boys and girls. Both contemporaneous and lagged
   levels of achievement significantly predict initiation. In addition,
   change in academic achievement is an important predictor of initiation.
   That is, students who demonstrate a deterioration of their academic
   achievement over time are more likely to start using marijuana. Poor
   academic achievement and deterioration of academic achievement should be
   considered as risk factors for initiation of marijuana use among rural
   adolescents. Initiatives targeted at improving academic achievement
   and/or drug use prevention initiatives designed for poor achieving
   students may help to prevent initiation of marijuana use.},

Abstract = {This paper provides information about the importance of non-pecuniary
   school characteristics, such as race and poverty, on teacher turnover in
   Georgia. Simple descriptive statistics indicate that new teachers are
   more likely to leave schools with lower test scores, lower income, or
   higher proportions of minorities. A linear probability and a competing
   risks model of transitions out of first teaching jobs allow us to
   separate the importance of these highly correlated school
   characteristics. The estimates imply that teachers are much more likely
   to exit schools with large proportions of minority students, and that
   the other univariate statistical relationships are driven to a large
   extent by their correlation with the minority variable. Thus, while the
   common notion that teachers are more likely to leave high poverty
   schools is correct, it occurs because teachers are more likely to leave
   a particular type of poor school-one with a large proportion of
   minorities. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We present a multiple spells-competing risks model of stopout, dropout,
   reenrollment, and graduation behavior. We find that students who
   experience an initial stopout are more likely to experience subsequent
   stopouts (occurrence dependence) and are less likely to graduate. We
   also find evidence of the impact of the length of an initial spell on
   the probability of subsequent events (lagged duration dependence). We
   simulate the impacts of race, family income, and high school performance
   on student behavior and show that there are often very large differences
   between unadjusted rates of student outcomes and adjusted rates.
   Differences in student performance often ascribed to race are shown to
   be the result of income, age at entry, and high school performance. (c)

Abstract = {Background This study models time to passing United States Medical
   Licensing Examination (USMLE) for the computer-based testing (CET)
   start-up cohort using the Cox Proportional Hazards Model.
   Method The number of days it took to pass Step 3 was treated as the
   dependent variable in the model. Covariates were: (1) gender; (2) native
   language (English or other); (3) medical school location (United States
   or other); and (4) citizenship (United States or other).
   Results Examinees were .59 times as likely to pass USMLE if they were
   trained abroad. Additionally, examinees who reported having English as
   their primary language and U.S. citizenship were more likely to
   ultimately pass USMLE. Finally, though gender was also associated with
   passing USMLE, its practical significance was very small.
   Conclusion Cox regression provides a useful tool for modeling
   performances in a continuous delivery model. Findings suggest that
   passing the USMLE sequence tends to be associated with native
   English-speaking USMGs who also hold U.S. citizenship.},

Abstract = {As of 2005,15 states had adopted a broad-based merit aid program,
   providing a combined \$1.2 billion for college students on the basis of
   academic qualifications. This represents a shift away from a long
   tradition of need-based aid at the state and federal levels. This
   article utilizes a Cox proportional hazards model to analyze states'
   characteristics that are associated with their probability of adopting a
   merit aid program. Lower levels of college continuation and educational
   attainment are found to increase the hazard for a state's adoption of a
   merit aid program, whereas higher levels of student out-migration
   decrease the proportional hazard for a state's adoption of such a
   program.},

Abstract = {This article applies theoretical and empirical insights on diffusion to
   a contemporary, important, and striking case in point: the groundswell
   of state legislation on and implementation of charter schools over the
   past decade. Drawing from several data sources and using event-history
   analyses, competing risks, and random-effects negative binomial
   regression, the analyses examine how interstate dynamics and intrastate
   attributes affect the adoption of legislation on and the creation of
   charter schools within states. The findings reveal a strong mimetic
   tendency among adjacent states to adopt charter school legislation and
   regional similarities in the creation of charter schools. Internal
   attributes of states, such as competition between the private and public
   school sectors, the relative strength of teachers' unions, the presence
   of racial competition, urbanization, and political party dominance
   likewise play a role, depending on whether the analytic focus is on the
   adoption of legislation or the implementation of policy. The authors
   conclude by discussing the implications of the results for understanding
   the forces underlying innovation and change in educational policy.},

Abstract = {Purpose To determine the long-term retention of rural family physicians
   graduating from the Physician Shortage Area Program (PSAP) of Jefferson
   Medical College.
   Method Of the 1,937 Jefferson graduates from the classes of 1978-1986,
   the authors identified those practicing rural family medicine when their
   practice location was first determined. The number and percent of PSAP
   and non-PSAP graduates practicing family medicine in the same rural area
   in 2002 were then identified, and compared to the number of those
   graduates practicing rural family medicine when they were first located
   in practice 11-16 years earlier.
   Results After 11-16 years, 68\% (26/38) of the PSAP graduates were still
   practicing family medicine in the same rural area, compared with 46\%
   (25/54) of their non-PSAP peers (p = .03). Survival analysis showed that
   PSAP graduates practice family medicine in the same rural locality
   longer than non-PSAP graduates (p = .04).
   Conclusions These results are the first to show long-term rural primary
   care retention that is longer than the median duration. This outcome
   combined with previously published outcomes show that the PSAP
   represents the only program that has resulted in multifold increases in
   both recruitment (eight-fold) and long-term retention (at least 11-16
   years). In light of recent national recommendations to increase the
   total enrollment in medical schools, allocating some of this growth to
   developing and expanding programs similar to the PSAP would make a
   substantial and long lasting impact on the rural physician workforce.},

   expectation that the factors leading to charter schools in a state will
   be different than the political climate in which takeover reform is
   realized. To test various hypotheses on the role of electoral dynamics

Title = {Job turnover and its correlates among residency program directors in

Journal = {ACADEMIC MEDICINE},

Volume = {76},

Pages = {1127-1135},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Purpose. In 1983, 43\% of internal medicine residency program directors
   had held their positions for less than three years. The purposes of this
   study were to determine the job turnover rate for internal medicine
   program directors, and the characteristics of program directors and
   residency programs that are associated with job turnover.
   Method. In October 1996, questionnaires were sent to all non-military
   internal medicine residency program directors in the continental United
   States listed by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical
   Education (ACGME). The questionnaire covered demographics, program
   characteristics, and job satisfaction. In October 1999, an updated ACGME
   list was used to contact programs to verify changes in program directors
   and determine the dates of change.
   Results. A total of 262 usable responses were received. At the beginning
   of the study, 49\% of the respondents had been on the job for three
   years or less, and 74 (29\%) were no longer program directors three
   years later. Overall job satisfaction was highly associated (p<.01) with
   turnover. Multivariate Cox regression modeling yielded four variables
   independently associated with turnover: low satisfaction with colleague
   relationships (hazard ratio = 3.2, 95\% CI=1.6-6.4), a high percentage
   of administrative work time (HR=2.9, 95\% CI=1.4-6.2), perceiving the
   job as a ``steppingstone{''} (HR=1.8, 95\% CI=1.0-3.2), and having had
   formal training to deal with problem residents (HR=0.6, 95\%
   CI=0.4-1.1). Respondents with burnout, with the titles of program
   director and chair or department chief, and with less than two years on
   the job had nonsignificant trends toward job turnover. Variables not
   associated with turnover included gender, rank, salary, and program
   size.
   Conclusions. Yearly turnover for internal medicine residency program
   directors is substantial. The four independent predictors of turnover
   identified in this study should be of interest to institutions
   recruiting or retaining program directors and to aspiring program
   directors.},

Abstract = {This research models default development for a large proprietary dataset
   of private (nonfederally guaranteed) education loans extended to law
   school students in the early 1990s, Employing the statistical techniques
   of survival analysis and credit scoring, the study documents a
   pronounced seasoning effect for such loans and demonstrates the robust
   predictive power of credit bureau scoring of student borrowers. Other
   constructs found to be statistically predictive of default include
   school-of-attendance (or, alternatively, a measure of perceived school
   reputation), geographic location of attended school, and new attorney
   unemployment rate within certain regions. Although statistically
   predictive, these last constructs are of far less substantive importance
   in assessing credit risk than are the effects of portfolio seasoning and
   scoring (an ordinal measure of the risk of extending credit to an
   individual based upon their past credit behavior). The article
   challenges the prevailing approach to modeling student loan default (one
   that searches for ``institutional{''} as well as ``borrower{''}
   explanations) and suggests a return to the older, simpler banking
   paradigm of borrower willingness and borrower ability to repay.},

   resident and international students, and students taking the Freshman
   Orientation Course appeared to be at reduced risk of dropping out.
   Statistically significant associations of retention with ethnicity/race

   regression model was developed to predict a student's probability of
   leaving school based on these demographic and academic variables. These

Title = {When are students most at risk of encountering academic difficulty? A
   study of the 1992 matriculants to US medical schools},
Journal = {ACADEMIC MEDICINE},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {74},
Number = {4},
Pages = {454-460},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The authors carried out the study reported here to assess which
   variables are most predictive of the risk of medical students'
   experiencing academic difficulties and to assess when these students are
   most susceptible to encountering those difficulties. The entering class
   of 1992 was chosen as the study population because it was the first
   matriculating class in which the majority of students (88\%) applied to
   medical school with Scores from the revised Medical College Admission
   Test (MCAT), first implemented in 1991. The primary event of interest in
   this study was the first occurrence of one of the following events
   because of academic difficulty: withdrawal, leave of absence, dismissal,
   or delay of graduation date. The variables examined were MCAT scores,
   undergraduate science GPA, undergraduate institutional selectivity,
   undergraduate major, racial-ethnic background, sex, and age upon
   entering medical school. Survival analysis was used to assess which
   variables were most predictive of the risk of academic difficulty and
   when students with different characteristics were most at risk.
   The results of the survival analysis indicated that (1) while the risk
   and timing of academic difficulty varied across the groups studied, a
   majority of the students who experienced academic difficulty eventually
   graduated from medical school; and (2) students with non science
   undergraduate majors did not have a greater risk of academic difficulty.
   The results confirm previous findings that increased risk of academic
   difficulty is associated with low MCAT scores, low science GPA, low
   undergraduate institutional selectivity, being a woman, being a member
   of a racial-ethnic underrepresented minority, or being older.
   The study findings can be generalized to help in early identification
   of-students who are more likely to be at risk of experiencing academic
   difficulty Knowing when these students are more likely to be at risk can
   help medical schools develop targeted remedial and enrichment programs.
   Further studies are needed to investigate school-related factors
   associated with risk.},

Volume = {18},

Abstract = {In this paper, we initiate a discussion of the possible methodological
   features of a potential new national longitudinal study of teachers'
   careers. We use a review of the substantive and methodological
   literatures and `'pseudolongitudinal'' analyses of data drawn from the
   National Center for Education Statistics' Schools and Staffing Survey
   and Teacher Follow-Up Survey to support our arguments. Our presentation
   is framed by six key principles of research design that are then used to
   support concrete recommendations about whom should be studied, how often
   they should be observed, and for how long the study should continue. Our
   six design principles assert that, in the new study we must collect
   truly longitudinal data, view time as both an outcome and a predictor
   collect data on both time-varying and time-invariant measures, collect
   data prospectively whenever possible, collect data beginning in multiple
   base years, and collect data at all relevant levels of the
   organizational hierarchy. Although it is impossible to define a single
   research design that is optimal for answering all research questions
   about the teaching career we recommend that the new study should sample
   from the population of teachers who are beginning their first, second,
   third, and subsequent spells, that each of these teachers be followed
   for at least 12 years (both in and out of teaching), and that they
   should be measured on at least six occasions during this period. We also
   recommend that the study be replicated starting in two, if not three,
   base years. We welcome public comment and discussion of our proposals.},

Abstract = {New York City is a major urban epicenter of the AIDS epidemic in the
   United States, and has reported nearly one fifth of the nation's cases.
   This paper chronicles trends in the AIDS epidemic among men who have sex
   with men (MSM) from 1981 through 1993 in New York City. Annual AIDS
   incidence and cumulative deaths are described, results of survival
   analysis by race/ethnicity for three time periods are reported, and the
   effects of the epidemic on premature mortality are shown from the
   beginning of the epidemic through 1993. Among 25,812 cases reported in
   MSM, 52\% were white, 25\% were black and 21\% were Hispanic. AIDS
   incidence among whites has been declining since 1987 and is continuing
   to increase among minorities. Survival has been improving over time
   among all groups analyzed, but a persistent differential in survival
   between different race and ethnic groups is found, with whites surviving
   longer than minorities. Overall, nearly one half a million person years
   of life before age 65 were lost among MSM between 1981 and 1993. A rapid
   increase in AIDS cases among men born 1970-79 who were diagnosed after
   1988 suggests a new wave of the epidemic may be occurring, and continued
   efforts in AIDS education and prevention among MSM entering the age of
   sexual activity is required.},

Abstract = {High dropout rates among students who repeated grades are often cited as

   history analysis to explore whether and how a grade retention influenced
   graduation outcomes among one cohort of youths from an urban school
   system.  Repeating a grade from kindergarten to sixth grade was
   associated with a substantial increase in the odds of dropping out even
   after controlling for differences in background and postretention grades
   and attendance.  This article explores whether grade retention may
   influence school dropout because it makes students overage for grade. 
   Students who ended sixth grade overage for grade experienced substantial
   disengagement during middle school; nearly one quarter dropped out, and
   those who remained had significant declines in attendance.  I find that
   the impact of being overage for grade during adolescence may explain a
   large proportion of the higher dropout rates among retained youths.},

Abstract = {Early intervention researchers often want to know whether and when
   critical events occur. Questions about event occurrence can be difficult
   to answer because of censoring; not everyone in the sample experiences
   the target event during the period of data collection. Yet for findings
   to be unbiased and representative, statistical analyses must include
   both censored and uncensored cases. In this paper, we show how methods
   of survival analysis are ideally suited for studying event occurrence.
   Using data describing entry into preschool among children with special
   needs, we introduce the fundamental statistical quantities-the hazard
   and survivor functions-and we show how to construct formal statistical
   models of event occurrence over time. We then identify the different
   types of predictors that can be included in hazard models and comment on
   the importance of these models for early intervention research. Finally,
   we describe how researchers who fail to adopt a survival analysis
   perspective can be led astray, producing erroneous conclusions about the
   predictors of event occurrence.},

Abstract = {Educational researchers frequently ask whether and, if so, when events
   occur. Until relatively recently, however, sound statistical methods for
   answering such questions have not been readily available. In this
   article, by empirical example and mathematical argument, we demonstrate
   how the methods of discrete-time survival analysis provide educational
   statisticians with an ideal framework for studying event occurrence.
   Using longitudinal data on the career paths of 3,941 special educators
   as a springboard, we derive maximum likelihood estimators for the
   parameters of a discrete-time hazard model, and we show how the model
   can be fit using standard logistic regression software. We then
   distinguish among the several types of main effects and interactions
   that can be included as predictors in the model, offering data analytic
   advice for the practitioner. To aid educational statisticians interested
   in conducting discrete-time survival analysis, we provide illustrative
   computer code (SAS, 1989) for fitting discrete-time hazard models and
   for recapturing fitted hazard and survival functions.},

Abstract = {Educational researchers studying student dropout and teacher attrition
   typically ask whether specific events occur by particular points in
   time. In this article, we argue that a more powerful and informative way
   of framing such questions is to ask when the transitions occur. We
   believe that researchers avoid asking questions about time-to-event
   ({''}When?{''}) because of methodological difficulties introduced when
   members of the sample do not experience the target events during the
   data collection period. These people-the students who do not graduate or
   drop out, the teachers who do not quit-possess censored event times.
   Until recently statistical techniques available for analyzing censored
   data were in their infancy. In this article, we show how the methods of
   survival analysis (also known as event history analysis) lend themselves
   naturally to the study of the timing of educational events. Drawing
   examples from the literature on teacher attrition and student dropout
   and graduation, we introduce a panoply of survival methods useful for
   describing the timing of educational transitions and for building
   statistical models of the risk of event occurrence over time. We hope
   that this nontechnical introduction to survival methods will help
   educational researchers articulate and explore important substantive
   questions that they have raised but have yet to answer.},
